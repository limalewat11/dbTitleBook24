In this cauldron Arawn has created his terrible army of deathless warriors from the stolen bodies of the slain. For each of those chosen to journey to Arawn&#39;s domain, the quest has a special meaning, and to Taran, Assistant Pig-Keeper, the adventure becomes a glorious opportunity to wear his first sword and prove himself a man among men.</p><p><b>Lloyd Alexander</b> (1924-2007) was the author of more than forty books for children and adults, including the beloved children&#x2019;s fantasy series, the Chronicles of Prydain, one of the most widely read series in the history of fantasy and the inspiration for the animated Disney film, <i>The Black Cauldron</i>. His books have won numerous awards, including the Newbery Medal, the Newbery Honor, and the National Book Award for Juvenile Literature.<br><b>Black Cauldron, The</b><br><b>CHAPTER ONE</b><b>The Council at Caer Dallben</b><b>A</b>utumn had come too swiftly. In the northernmost realms of Prydain many trees were already leafless, and among the branches clung the ragged shapes of empty nests. To the south, across the river Great Avren, the hills shielded Caer Dallben from the winds, but even here the little farm was drawing in on itself.For Taran, the summer was ending before it had begun. That morning Dallben had given him the task of washing the oracular pig. Had the old enchanter ordered him to capture a full-grown gwythaint, Taran would gladly have set out after one of the vicious winged creatures. As it was, he filled the bucket at the well and trudged reluctantly to Hen Wen's enclosure. The white pig, usually eager for a bath, now squealed nervously and rolled on her back in the mud. Busy struggling to raise Hen Wen to her feet, Taran did not notice the horseman until he had reined up at the pen."You, there! Pig-boy!" The rider looking down at him was a youth only a few years older than Taran. His hair was tawny, his eyes black and deep-set in a pale, arrogant face. Though of excellent quality, his garments had seen much wear, and his cloak was purposely draped to hide his threadbare attire. The cloak itself, Taran saw, had been neatly and painstakingly mended. He satastride a roan mare, a lean and nervous steed speckled red and yellow, with a long, narrow head, whose expression was as ill-tempered as her master's."You, pig-boy," he repeated, "is this Caer Dallben?"The horseman's tone and bearing nettled Taran, but he curbed his temper and bowed courteously. "It is," he replied. "But I am not a pig-boy," he added. "I am Taran, Assistant Pig-Keeper.""A pig is a pig," said the stranger, "and a pig-boy is a pig-boy. Run and tell your master I am here," he ordered. "Tell him that Prince Ellidyr Son of Pen-Llarcau ..."Hen Wen seized this opportunity to roll into another puddle. "Stop that, Hen!" Taran cried, hurrying after her."Leave off with that sow," Ellidyr commanded. "Did you not hear me? Do as I say, and be quick about it.""Tell Dallben yourself!" Taran called over his shoulder, trying to keep Hen Wen from the mud. "Or wait until I've done with my own work!""Mind your impudence," Ellidyr answered, "or you shall have a good beating for it."Taran flushed. Leaving Hen Wen to do as she pleased, he strode quickly to the railing and climbed over. "If I do," he answered hotly, throwing back his head and looking Ellidyr full in the face, "it will not be at <i>your</i> hands."Ellidyr gave a scornful laugh. Before Taran could spring aside, the roan plunged forward. Ellidyr, leaning from the saddle, seized Taran by the front of the jacket. Taran flailed his arms and legs vainly. Strong as he was, he could not break free. He was pummeled and shaken until his teeth rattled. Ellidyr then urged the roan into a gallop, hauled Taran across the turf to the cottage, andthere, while chickens scattered in every direction, tossed him roughly to the ground.The commotion brought Dallben and Coll outdoors. The Princess Eilonwy hurried from the scullery, her apron flying and a cook-pot still in her hand. With a cry of alarm she ran to Taran's side.Ellidyr, without troubling to dismount, called to the white-bearded enchanter. "Are you Dallben? I have brought your pig-boy to be thrashed for his insolence.""Tut!" said Dallben, unperturbed by Ellidyr's furious expression. "Whether he is insolent is one thing, and whether he should be thrashed is another. In either case, I need no suggestions from you.""I am a Prince of Pen-Llarcau!" cried Ellidyr."Yes, yes, yes," Dallben interrupted with a wave of his brittle hand. "I am quite aware of all that and too busy to be concerned with it. Go, water your horse and your temper at the same time. You shall be called when you are wanted."Ellidyr was about to reply, but the enchanter's stern glance made him hold his tongue. He turned the roan and urged her toward the stable.Princess Eilonwy and the stout, baldheaded Coll, meantime, had been helping Taran pick himself up."You should know better, my boy, than to quarrel with strangers," said Coll good-naturedly."That's true enough," Eilonwy added. "Especially if they're on horseback and you're on foot.""Next time I meet him," Taran began."When you meet again," said Dallben, "you, at least, shall conduct yourself with as much restraint and dignity as possible--which, I allow, may not be very great, but you shall have to makedo with it. Be off, now. The Princess Eilonwy can help you to be a little more presentable than you are at the moment."In the lowest of spirits, Taran followed the golden-haired girl to the scullery. He still smarted, more from Ellidyr's words than from the drubbing; and he was hardly pleased that Eilonwy had seen him sprawled at the feet of the arrogant Prince."However did it happen?" Eilonwy asked, picking up a damp cloth and applying it to Taran's face.Taran did not answer, but glumly submitted to her care.Before Eilonwy had finished, a hairy figure, covered with leaves and twigs, popped up at the window, and with great agility clambered over the sill."Woe and sadness!" the creature wailed, loping anxiously to Taran. "Gurgi sees smackings and whackings by strengthful lord! Poor, kindly master! Gurgi is sorry for him."But there is news!" Gurgi hurried on. "Good news! Gurgi also sees mightiest of princes riding! Yes, yes, with great gallopings on white horse with black sword, what joy!""What's that?" cried Taran. "Do you mean Prince Gwydion? It can't be ...""It is," said a voice behind him.Gwydion stood in the doorway.With a shout of amazement, Taran ran forward and clasped his hand. Eilonwy threw her arms about the tall warrior, while Gurgi joyfully pounded the floor. The last time Taran had seen him, Gwydion wore the raiment of a prince of the royal House of Don. Now he was dressed simply in a hooded cloak of gray and a coarse, unadorned jacket. The black sword, Dyrnwyn, hung at his side."Well met, all of you," said Gwydion. "Gurgi looks as hungry asever, Eilonwy prettier than ever. And you, Assistant Pig-Keeper," he added, his lined and weathered face breaking into a smile, "a little the worse for wear. Dallben has mentioned how you came by those bruises.""I sought no quarrel," Taran declared."But one found you, nonetheless," Gwydion said. "I think that must be the way of it with you, Taran of Caer Dallben. No matter," he said, stepping back and studying Taran closely through green-flecked eyes. "Let me look at you. You have grown since last we met." Gwydion nodded his shaggy, wolf-gray head in approval. "I hope you have gained as much wisdom as height. We shall see. Now I must make ready for the council.""Council?" Taran cried. "Dallben said nothing of a council. He did not even say you were coming here.""The truth is," Eilonwy put in, "Dallben hasn't been saying much of anything to anybody.""You should understand by now," said Gwydion, "that of what he knows, Dallben tells little. Yes, there is to be a council, and I have summoned others to meet us here.""I am old enough to sit in a council of men," Taran interrupted excitedly. "I have learned much; I have fought at your side, I have ...""Gently, gently," Gwydion said. "We have agreed you shall have a place. Though manhood," he added softly, with a trace of sadness, "may not be all that you believe." Gwydion put his hands on Taran's shoulders. "Meanwhile, stand ready. Your task will be given soon enough."&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As Gwydion had foretold, the rest of the morning brought many new arrivals. A company of horsemen soon appeared and began tomake camp in the stubble field beyond the orchard. The warriors, Taran saw, were armed for battle. His heart leaped. Surely this, too, had to do with Gwydion's council. His head spun with questions and he hurried toward the field. He had not gone halfway when he stopped short in great surprise. Two familiar figures were riding up the pathway. Taran raced to meet them."Fflewddur!" he called, while the bard, his beautiful harp slung over his shoulder, raised a hand in greeting. "And Doli! Is that really you?"The crimson-haired dwarf swung down from his pony. He grinned broadly for an instant, then assumed his customary scowl. He did not, however, conceal the glint of pleasure in his round, red eyes."Doli!" Taran clapped the dwarf on the back. "I never thought I'd see you again. That is, really see you. Not after you gained the power to be invisible.""Humph!" snorted the leather-jacketed dwarf. "Invisible! I've had all I want of that. Do you realize the effort it takes? Terrible! It makes my ears ring. And that's not the worst of it. Nobody can see you, so you get your toes stepped on, or an elbow jabbed in your eye. No, no, not for me. I can't stand it any more!""And you, Fflewddur," Taran cried, as the bard dismounted, "I've missed you. Do you know what the council is about? That's why you're here, isn't it? And Doli, too?""I know nothing about councils," muttered Doli. "King Eiddileg commanded me to come here. A special favor to Gwydion. But I can tell you right now I'd rather be back home in the realm of the Fair Folk, minding my own business.""In my case," said the bard, "Gwydion happened to be passingthrough my kingdom--purely by chance, it seemed--though now I'm beginning to think it wasn't. He suggested I might enjoy stopping down at Caer Dallben. He said good old Doli was going to be there, so of course I set out immediately."I'd given up being a bard," Fflewddur continued, "and had settled quite happily as ...</p><h2>Bottom of the 33rd: Hope, Redemption, and Baseball&#39;s Longest Game</h2><p><p>&#x201c;<em>Bottom of the 33rd</em> is chaw-chewing, sunflower-spitting, pine tar proof that too much baseball is never enough.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jane Leavy, author of <em>The Last Boy</em> and <em>Sandy Koufax</em>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What a book&#x2014;an exquisite exercise in story-telling, democracy and myth-making.&#x201d; &#x2014;Colum McCann, winner of the National Book Award for&nbsp; <em>Let The Great World Spin</em>&nbsp;</p><p>From Pulitzer Prize-winning <em>New York Times</em> columnist Dan Barry comes the beautifully recounted story of the longest game in baseball history&#x2014;a tale celebrating not only the robust intensity of baseball, but the aspirational ideal epitomized by the hard-fighting players of the minor leagues. In the tradition of <em>Moneyball</em>, <em>The Last Hero</em>, and <em>Wicked Good Year</em>, Barry&#x2019;s <em>Bottom of the 33rd </em>is a reaffirming story of the American Dream finding its greatest expression in timeless contests of the Great American Pastime. </p></p><p><p>On April 18, 1981, a ball game sprang eternal. What began as a modestly attended minor-league game between the Pawtucket Red Sox and the Rochester Red Wings became not only the longest ever played in baseball history, but something else entirely. The first pitch was thrown after dusk on Holy Saturday, and for the next eight hours the night seemed to suspend its participants between their collective pasts and futures, between their collective sorrows and joys&#x2014;the ballplayers; the umpires; Pawtucket's ejected manager, peering through a hole in the backstop; the sportswriters and broadcasters; a few stalwart fans shivering in the cold.</p><p>With <em>Bottom of the 33rd</em>, celebrated <em>New York Times</em> journalist Dan Barry has written a lyrical meditation on small-town lives, minor-league dreams, and the elements of time and community that conspired one fateful night to produce a baseball game seemingly without end. <em>Bottom of the 33rd</em> captures the sport's essence: the purity of purpose, the crazy adherence to rules, the commitment of both players and fans. This genre-bending book, a reportorial triumph, portrays the myriad lives held in the night's unrelenting grip. Consider, for instance, the team owner determined to revivify a decrepit stadium, built atop a swampy bog, or the batboy approaching manhood, nervous and earnest, or the umpire with a new family and a new home, or the wives watching or waiting up, listening to a radio broadcast slip into giddy exhaustion. Consider the small city of Pawtucket itself, its ghosts and relics, and the players, two destined for the Hall of Fame (Cal Ripken and Wade Boggs), a few to play only briefly or forgettably in the big leagues, and the many stuck in minor-league purgatory, duty bound and loyal to the game.</p><p>An unforgettable portrait of ambition and endurance, <em>Bottom of the 33rd</em> is the rare sports book that changes the way we perceive America's pastime, and America's past.</p><p>Dan Barry is a reporter and columnist for the <em>New York Times</em>.

Bumbling, sad, ironic, Ram is also a man corroded by a terrible secret. With the assassination of the politician Rajiv Gandhi, Ram is plunged into a series of escalating and possibly deadly political betrayals. As he tries to save his family, his daughter reveals a crime he had hoped was long buried-and Ram, struggling to survive, must make amends after a life of deception. Taking the reader deep into a world of Indian families and politics, gangsters and movie stars, riots and morgues, An Obedient Father is an astonishing fiction debut, a work of rare sensibilities that presents a character as tormented, funny, and morally ambiguous as one of Dostoyevsky's antiheroes.<br> <br></p><p>Readers opening this first novel from Akhil Sharma find themselves face to face with a wildly unappealing main character. Ram Karan is a corrupt civil servant, chubby and self-hating. "I had been Mr. Gupta's moneyman for a little less than a year and was no good." Ram has no illusions about his failings: "My panic in negotiations was so apparent that even people who were eager to bribe me became resentful." Things at home aren't so hot either: Ram's wife has recently died, as has his son-in-law, and so his daughter Anita and granddaughter, Asha, have moved in with him. The first chapter of <i>An Obedient Father</i> is lugubrious and oily and awkward, like its narrator; then suddenly the whole thing breaks wide open. Drunk one night, Ram touches Asha with his penis. Anita walks in, and the family's secret is out all at once, like a just-freed, very angry cat: Ram forced Anita to have sex with him repeatedly when she was 12.<p> Sharma, a Delhi-born New York investment banker, has written a novel that's satisfyingly ambitious and full of really lovely imagery (tulips, for instance, are "heavy-hearted"). He squares Ram's downfall in the context of the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. As India descends into political turmoil, Ram is made accountable for corruption both at work and at home. What gives the book its engine is its even-tempered handling of Ram himself: he is always complex, never a moral lesson or a villain. By the time Anita exacts her quietly devilish revenge, we feel neither glee nor pity, just sadness. Sharma doesn't have perfect control of his material--the transitions between personal and political can be abrupt, the tension between father and daughter unravels sloppily. Still, this is a new voice of great subtlety and care. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>Akhil Sharma was born in India in 1971. His stories have been published in the Best New American Stories and O.

Now there are rumors that Jane and Bill may move in together, and Dorothy needs to know exactly what's happening. What neither woman expects is that Bill is missing, and that within a day his body is going to be discovered in the tunnel under the Sherebury town museum.<br><br>Why would anyone want to harm a harmless old man, a historian who loves the town and the people who live there?

NOT ONLY A MONDAY, but December eighth. Exactly seventeen days till Christmas and I had done almost nothing. No cookies had been baked, no cards sent, no presents bought, let alone wrapped.It's true that I'm a chronic procrastinator, but this time I had a good excuse. Recent events, including a fairly narrow escape from being murdered, had taken up a good deal of my time and every bit of my energy.However, excuses notwithstanding, Christmas was going to be here in a little over two weeks, and I wasn't going to be ready, not unless I got my act together immediately. I poured myself the last cup of coffee in the pot, checked to make sure that my husband was happily occupied with his memoirs, and sat down to make a list.Half an hour later I kissed Alan on the top of his head as he sat absorbed in front of the computer. "I'm going shopping. I may not be home for lunch. There's soup in the fridge."He muttered something. I knew he'd really heard me and would remember what I'd said when he got hungry and I wasn't there. I patted his shoulder fondly and went out the back door, clapping an old plaid tam on my head.It was an incredibly beautiful day for December. The temperature wasat least fifty, the sun was shining brightly, and the jasmine on the south wall of my house was in full, fragrant bloom. Perverse creature that I am, I resented the weather. My soul, nourished by more than sixty years of life in the Midwestern United States, insisted that there should be snow. It was a foolish longing. We seldom got much snow here in the part of southeastern England I'd adopted as my home.Never mind. By the time I got back home I'd be glad enough of dry feet and warm hands and would, I hoped, be imbued with the somewhat frenetic Christmas cheer forced upon me by the merchants.I knocked on my neighbor's back door. Jane Langland, my best friend, was often willing to accompany me on my jaunts, and I find shopping much less tiring with company.I was greeted by Jane's bulldogs. I'm never sure how many she has. Soft touch that she is, she's forever bringing home a new one from the animal shelter and then placing it in a good home, so the population varies. They are all invariably good-humored, gregarious, and extremely interested in the way I smell (perhaps because I have two cats). I patted the nearest ones, shoved away the too-curious ones, and waited until Jane herded them all out of the way and motioned me into her pleasant kitchen."Sorry. Miserable beasts," she said in fond tones that belied her words. "Coffee?""Thanks, but I don't have time to stay. I'm off to do my extremely belated Christmas shopping, and hoped you'd come with me.""Well." She considered. "Laundry folded, washing-up done, no committees today--right. Why not? Want to stop at the museum in any case."She looked at her feet as she muttered the last remark, and I tried hard not to smile. "Do you have a present for Bill?""No. Need to talk to him." She spoke gruffly and stumped out into the vestibule. She pulled a sweater off a peg. "Coming, then?""How has Bill been?" I pursued as we walked past my house. It's at the end of the street, which is a dead end terminating with a gate into theCathedral Close. The quickest route to the High Street and most of the shops is through the Cathedral. "I haven't visited the museum lately.""Hmph! Blinking fool!"I took this to refer to Bill, not me. And I was pretty sure I knew why she was upset. "So he still won't come to live with you?""Hah! Sensible thing to do, with both of us lonely, and nearly eighty, and him an old crock who can barely walk. Not taking proper care of himself.""Well, I've said before and I say again, I think there's a reason. Don't look at me that way! I don't think he's suddenly lost his fondness for you, so it must be something else. Maybe he doesn't like your house. Maybe he doesn't care for dogs. Maybe he hates the idea of living so close to the church bells. Maybe he's just afraid of losing his independence.""Hmph!" said Jane again. I thought she was going to say something else, but she shook her head and closed her mouth firmly.I was thoughtful as we took the shortcut through the Cathedral and out again and turned onto the High Street. Jane had told me, in bits and pieces, about her decades-old romance, and I found the story infinitely pathetic.She and Bill Fanshawe, neighbors in Sherebury long ago, had known each other from infancy, but love had blossomed when they were just eighteen, in 1943. They desperately wanted to marry, but that was a bad time for romance. Their families insisted they were both too young and times too uncertain. Bill had enlisted in the RAF as soon as he was old enough, promising he would marry her as soon as the war was over and he came home.But he hadn't come home when the war was over. His plane had been shot down over Germany and Bill taken prisoner. His prison camp was liberated in due time, of course, but under the harsh conditions his injuries had never healed properly. A broken leg, badly set, left him crippled and unable to work at his previous factory job. Even after English doctorsdid the best they could, he was unfit for factory work and untrained for any other job that could support a wife. Jane had begun her teaching career by that time, so she was earning a little. Bill doggedly worked at whatever menial jobs he could find while he studied history at Sherebury University. They both lived with their parents and tried to save, but the post-war austerity programs made life hard and saving almost impossible.Then, in the early fifties, Bill's father was offered a better job in Norwich. The family moved, and Bill, unable to support himself, had little choice but to go with them. In the bigger city, Bill, too, was able to find a better job, his knowledge of history leading to work in the city's museum. The two lovers tried to keep up a correspondence, but since neither had the time or the money to travel to see the other, the letters became unsatisfactory and eventually lapsed. Jane lost touch with Bill except for the occasional Christmas card. Neither married. Time went by.It was in the mid-nineties, as I recalled, that Bill retired and decided to return to Sherebury. He found a comfortable little flat in what had been a wool merchant's grand house in the seventeenth century. He had finished his degree and become a curator of some note by that time, so when the small Museum of Sherebury moved into the splendid old Town Hall and lost wispy little Mr. Pym, its old curator, Bill was a logical successor. He settled in happily and began to see Jane now and then.The trouble was, they'd both become set in their ways. If they'd hoped (as the gossipy little town, eagerly awaiting developments, certainly hoped) to take up where they'd left off, they were disappointed. A late-life romance did not develop. But they still shared many of the same interests and enjoyed each other's company. The town held its collective breath and kept hoping, until a major rift developed.The trouble arose when Bill fell on the stairs getting to his flat, which was on the top floor of the old house. He wasn't hurt, only shaken up, but Jane was extremely upset. Being Jane, she tried to take charge. Bill,with the old weakness in his leg, had no business climbing all those stairs, she insisted. In fact, he had no business living alone at his age.When she had recounted the conversation to me, I had refrained from saying that she lived alone, in a house with many stairs, and that she was the same age as Bill. I wasted my tact. It seemed that Bill had pointed out that very fact. Jane had then changed tactics and said there was no sense in both of them living alone. She would be more than happy to have him move in with her, as a paying guest if he liked, and they'd be there for each other in case of illness or other disaster.Well, that put the fat in the fire. Bill backed off like a scalded cat. I thought, personally, that he took the suggestion as a backhanded sort of marriage proposal, and was scared to death of the idea. I didn't say so to Jane, of course. She was mortally offended, and became even more upset when Bill up and moved to Heatherwood House, a retirement home in a beautiful old manor house on the edge of town. At one blow he had rejected her, dealt with all her objections about his unsafe living conditions, and distanced himself from her physically as well.Jane Langland is one of the kindest people I know. She's also one of the stubbornest, and I'm well equipped to recognize the trait. She didn't give up. She called on him at the museum every chance she got, raising some new argument. I suspected that they secretly enjoyed the quarrels a good deal, and I was looking forward to watching them spar today.Not yet, though. Shopping came first. List clutched in my hand, I steered Jane firmly in the direction opposite the Town Hall.Two hours later, only halfway through my list, I was more than ready to stop for lunch. My feet hurt, my arms were weighed down with packages, I had a headache, and I was starving. So much for Christmas spirit. "Jane, let's go to Alderney's. It's about halfway home, and even with your help, I can't carry all this stuff much farther. Besides, they have wonderful food and I don't have much at home.""Better idea. Town Hall's just across the street. Pop in there and leave your parcels.""That is a good idea! And maybe Bill will come to lunch with us, if his assistant is there today." I glanced slyly at Jane, but she refused to meet my eye.We staggered across the street. Jane opened the heavy old oak door and I negotiated the half flight of stairs to the level where the museum occupied the space vacated some years before by the city offices. The architects, with Bill to advise them, had done a lovely job with it. The building retained its Elizabethan dignity, and the artifacts of centuries of Sherebury history were displayed attractively.The desk he usually occupied in the corner was vacant, and there was no sign of his assistant."Jane, he must be upstairs looking something up, and I positively cannot climb any more stairs." Bill, I knew, had been doing a lot of work lately in the storerooms, pulling out odd bits and pieces that had been donated to the museum years ago and trying to make some sense of them."HELLO-O!" Jane's stentorian bellow raised some dust motes that eddied in the sunlight coming through a leaded-glass window. There was no other response."Old fool's fallen asleep up there. Suppose I'd best wake him."Jane made for the stairs while I sank gratefully into a chair. Jane's older than I, but better able to climb stairs, especially when my arthritic knees are acting up. I often think it's unfair that I feel about thirty-five on the inside, but the outer shell sometimes seems to be approaching a hundred. I leaned back as far as the rather hard chair would allow and closed my eyes. I'd have time for forty winks before Jane persuaded Bill to leave his work and come to lunch with us.She came back before I'd reached even the edge of sleep. "He's not there," she announced.Her tone of voice roused me. "But--he'd surely never leave the place unattended. He must have gone to the loo.""Knocked. Then peeked in. No one."This was unexpected. Bill Fanshawe was fanatically reliable. He viewed the museum's collection as virtually his own property, and guarded it jealously. He would never have walked off with the doors unlocked. I tried to make my weary brain function properly. "Maybe he isn't here at all today, and his assistant has done something foolish--gone off for a sandwich or whatever, and left the museum open."Jane, prowling restlessly, reached Bill's desk and did some rummaging. "No," she said, holding up one of the papers. "Schedule for the week. Bill's here alone today."I looked at her blankly. "Well, then, where is he?"Copyright � 2004 by Jeanne M.

Mactire, author of Victims of Domestic Violence, explores the fact and fiction of who these people are, why they commit their crimes, how they choose their victims and how people catch them.</p><p>In the same vein as Keith D. Wilson's <i>Cause of Death</i> (1992) and Anne Wingate's <i>Scene of the Crime</i> (1992), this matter-of-fact book about the criminal mind will be of interest to true-crime aficionados as well as writers. Mactire's "roadmap to the shadow world of the criminal mind" starts off with ancient history (from 1500 B.C.) and moves on to present-day serial and "nonserial" killers and wise guys. The author offers a fascinating discussion on how the creation of a police force changed criminal activity from open assault to cunning and secret operations. He examines the psychology of criminals and the development of profiling (psychological mug shots). In discussing the various types of and motives for crime, Mactire draws examples from the careers of actual criminals. All this fact and history will provide great fodder for writers of fiction and nonfiction. <i>Denise Perry Donavin</i></p><h2>The Art of the Catapult: Build Greek Ballistae, Roman Onagers, English Trebuchets, and More Ancient Artillery</h2><p>Whether playing at defending their own castle or simply chucking pumpkins over a fence, wannabe marauders and tinkerers will become fast acquainted with Ludgar, the War Wolf, Ill Neighbor, Cabulus, and the Wild Donkey&#x2014;ancient artillery devices known commonly as catapults. Building these simple yet sophisticated machines introduces fundamentals of math and physics using levers, force, torsion, tension, and traction. Instructions and diagrams illustrate how to build seven authentic working model catapults, including an early Greek ballista, a Roman onager, and the apex of catapult technology, the English trebuchet. Additional projects include learning how to lash and make rope and how to construct and use a hand sling and a staff sling. The colorful history of siege warfare is explored through the stories of Alexander the Great and his battle of Tyre; Saladin, Richard the Lionheart, and the Third Crusade; pirate-turned-soldier John Crabbe and his ship-mounted catapults; and Edward I of England and his battle against the Scots at Stirling Castle.<br></p><p>William Gurstelle is the author of <i>Absinthe and Flamethrowers</i>,&nbsp; <i>The Art of the Catapult</i>,&nbsp; the bestselling <i>Backyard Ballistics</i>,&nbsp;<i>Building Bots</i>, <i>Whoosh, Boom, Splat</i>, and <i>Notes from the Technology Underground</i>. He is a professional engineer who has been researching and building model catapults and ballistic devices for more than 30 years. He is a contributing editor at&nbsp;<i>Make</i> magazine and writes frequently for <i>Wired</i>, <i>The Rake</i>, and several other national magazines. He can be contacted at nfttu.blogspot.com.Grade 5 Up&#x2013;This collection of 10 working catapult projects offers a fascinating look at world history, military strategy, and physics, related with an engaging yet lighthearted touch. This historical context makes the projects all the more interesting. The working model of the Macedonian Ballista is cool, but even more so when one learns the role that catapults played in the campaigns of Alexander the Great. Instructions are clear, with full materials lists, helpful diagrams, and no skipped steps. Saw and drill are often required, along with hardware store purchases such as PVC pipe or specifically sized wood. Some of the finished results are large, such as God's Stone Thrower, a 5' x 5' construction with considerable flinging power, while a couple are smaller, tabletop-sized models that still propel successfully. Since the ultimate object is to fling things through the air, there is repeated emphasis on safety, including a first chapter entitled "Always Be Careful," an "adult supervision required" statement for every construction, and repeated warnings within the text. As for projectiles, water balloons, peanuts, and plastic cows are mentioned among "suitable ammunition," rather than the venomous snakes, cattle manure, or severed heads referred to in the historical portions. There's excellent booktalk potential here, and lively reading even for those who never get around to constructing a catapult.<i>&#x2013;Steven Engelfried, Beaverton City Library, OR</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Fourteen-year-old Allison is stranded above the Arctic Circle when the small plane in which she is flying crashes and the pilot is killed. She is rescued by an I?upiat hunter. While she awaits the repair of the radio so she can reach her mother, who teaches in Alaska. Allison is drawn into the village community. Although filled with interesting details about the I?upiat way of life and the challenges posed by increasing contact with the outside world, the events are nevertheless predictable and the characters superficial and sometimes stereotyped. Allison, who begins the book as self-centered and materialistic, of course matures and changes through her exposure to another culture, but she seems merely a device, never a fully realized and sympathetic character. A clunky subplot concerning an outcast deaf girl whom she befriends because she happens to know sign language seems gratuitous. Despite the author's obvious knowledge of the territory, the novel remains pedestrian and readers remain, as does Allison, on the outside looking in.<br><i>Cyrisse Jaffee, formerly at Newton Public Schools, MA</i><br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Father of Spin: Edward L. Bernays and the Birth of Public Relations</h2><p><b>The Father of Spin</b> is the first full-length biography of the legendary Edward L. Bernays, who, beginning in the 1920s, was one of the first and most successful practitioners of the art of public relations. This book tells of Bernays's great campaigns, including: His precedent-setting work for the American Tobacco Company, climaxed by a parade of cigarette-smoking debutantes down Fifth Avenue on Easter Sunday that recast smoking as an act of liberation for women, helped convince a generation of women to light up, and made headlines from coast to coast. He transformed the color green into an American favorite to blend in with the green of the Lucky Strike package, and he convinced weight-conscious women that a cigarette was just the thing to substitute for a sweet. And he did it all without anyone knowing his client was behind it. <br><br>How he and his client the United Fruit Company helped engineer the overthrow of the socialist regime in Guatemala in the 1950s.<br><br>How he borrowed ideas from his uncle Sigmund Freud to push people to buy products they didn't need and to shape the way they perceived issues and the very way they believed. <br>And what Bernays did for tobacco and fruit peddlers, he also did for politicians, including Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover. <br><br>In <b>The Father of Spin</b>, <i>Boston Globe</i> reporter Larry Tye, drawing on interviews with primary sources and voluminous private papers, presents a fascinating and revealing portrait of the man who, more than any other, defined and personified public relations, a profession that today helps shape our political discourse and define our commercial choices.</p><p>Biographer Larry Tye can't help but be entertained by his subject's professional antics. Edward L. Bernays (1892-1995), a pioneering practitioner of public relations, zestfully ballyhooed his clients, utilizing a shrewd blend of publicity stunts, careful cultivation of the press, and solicited endorsements from "experts." Yet journalist Tye is also aware of the moral ambiguities inherent in the career of a man who vigorously promoted cigarette smoking and whose work for the United Fruit Company played at least some role in the 1954 military overthrow of Guatemala's democratically elected government. This judicious book balances appreciation for Bernays' inventiveness with a sober understanding of its consequences, including the extent to which PR permeates contemporary American life. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>"For the vast punditocracy who think they created spin and the chattering classes who disdain what they think is a modern phenomenon, Larry Tye provides the un-spun history of the father of it all. A must-read for the aforementioned and wannabe spinmasters." <br>--Mary Matalin, The Mary Matalin Show<br><br>"Edward L. Bernays spent his life discovering what made us tick and what would influence our behavior. Larry Tye examined Edward L. Bernays and lets us in on the answers he found.

At the same time, while preparing for the Sandman 10th anniversary, he met Yoshitaka Amano, his artist for the 11th Sandman book. Amano is the famed designer of the <i>Final Fantasy</i> game series. The product of Gaiman's immersion in Japanese art, culture, and history, <i>Sandman: Dream Hunters</i> is a classic Japanese tale (adapted from "The Fox, the Monk, and the Mikado of All Night's Dreaming") that he has subtly morphed into his Sandman universe. <p> Like most fables, the story begins with a wager between two jealous animals, a fox and a badger: which of them can drive a young monk from his solitary temple? The winner will make the temple into a new fox or badger home. But as the fox adopts the form of a woman to woo the monk from his hermitage, she falls in love with him. Meanwhile, in far away Kyoto, the wealthy Master of Yin-Yang, the <i>onmyoji</i>, is plagued by his fears and seeks tranquility in his command of sorcery. He learns of the monk and his inner peace; he dispatches demons to plague the monk in his dreams and eventually kill him to bring his peace to the onmyoji. The fox overhears the demons on their way to the monk and begins her struggle to save the man whom at first she so envied.</p><p> <i>Dream Hunters</i> is a beautiful package. From the ink-brush painted endpapers to the luminous page layouts--including Amano's gate-fold painting of Morpheus in a sea of reds, oranges, and violets--this book has been crafted for a sensuous reading experience. Gaiman has developed as a prose stylist in the last several years with novels and stories such as <i>Neverwhere</i> and <i>Stardust</i>, and his narrative rings with a sense of timelessness and magic that gently sustains this adult fairy tale. The only disappointment here is that the book is so brief. One could imagine this creative team being even better suited to a longer story of more epic proportions. On the final page of <i>Dream Hunters</i>, in fact, Amano suggest that he will collaborate further with Mr. Gaiman in the future. Readers of <i>Dream Hunters</i> will hope that Amano's dream comes true. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>Gaiman's enormously successful Sandman monthly comic book (1989-96), which won eight Eisner awards in a row for comic book excellence, has been collected in a series of equally successful graphic novels. This book, representing Gaiman's first Sandman story in three years, retells Japanese folk tale "The Fox, the Monk, and the Mikado of All Night's Dreaming." The central characters are the Fox and the Monk, and the Sandman only plays a peripheral role. The book isn't really a graphic novel, as there are roughly 60 pages of typed prose and 60 pages of illustrations. It is an illustrated novel that remains true to both the Japanese tale and the motifs that made the Sandman series so popular. The illustrations are reminiscent of Japanese brush work and gently push the text along. Not the best first Sandman purchase for any library, this book is a necessary purchase if your patrons are Sandman readers, or if your world folk tales collection needs strengthening--Stephen Weiner, Maynard P.L., MA <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Jungle Book (Junior Classics for Young Readers)</h2><p>Classics that children ages 7 years and up will enjoy.</p><p></p><h2>The Archer and the Sun (Story Cove)</h2><p><p><strong><em>Why does the sun go up in the morning and down at night? </em></strong></p><p><em>The Archer and the Sun</em> is an ancient story from China.

With all of the techniques needed to produce Ruth&#39;s beautiful designs explained in clear, step-by-step photographs, this superb book will appeal to both beginners and experienced embroiderers alike.</p><p>Ruth Chamberlin studied drawing and dress at Croydon Art School before moving on to the School of Embroidery, London, where she studied ecclesiastical embroidery. After leaving the school, Ruth worked at the Warham Guild in London where she embroidered a cope and mitre for the Archbishop of Cantebury. Ruth now works on her own commissions, and has taught in adult education for over thirty years.No. 45, Feb/Mar 07 The title of this book perhaps gives the impression that it's very basic, but it's ideal for both the beginner and the more advanced embroiderer. If you haven't tried goldwork before or lack confidence, Ruth's clear instructions, looking at materials, stitches, how to transfer designs, raise surfaces and more, will be a boon. Techniques are explained in detailed step-by-step photographs illustrating each stage and include beautifully finished pieces that will appeal to all embroiderers. She also shares hints on how to get that perfect finish. * Stitch * Issue 165, Jan 07 ...this book is absolutely essential for anyone with an interest in learning how to work ecclesiastical Goldwork. Ruth takes the reader through the basics with information about the various fabrics and threads plus a vital chapter on how to prepare a slate frame. Each of the main stitches are fully explained which are taken from one of Ruth's samplers and components of this are used to explain the individual techniques...It is worth mentioning that only components of the sampler are provided, not the entire design itself, but in an initial practise piece this is all that is required. There is an acorn sprig that is a design in itself that can be completed once you have tackled the stitches preceding it. The book concentrates on the use of Jap threads which is predominately used in ecclesiastic Goldwork so as to keep the embroidery, which is mainly used on copes and stoles, supple and light. * NEW STITCHES * Dec 06/Jan 07 Large scale colour photographs to illustrate stitches, techniques and finished items make this a really clear book to follow for anyone new to Goldwork. * Needle &amp; Hobby Crafts * Oct 06 This book would be invaluable to anyone with an interest in the Traditional skills of Embroidery. The author has produced an excellent guide to the use of goldwork in both ancient and modern embroidery designs. It starts with setting up the frame and explains the different kinds of threads, stitches and materials needed to complete professional stitching. The techniques are explained very clearly with diagrams and photographs which are easy to follow. Any reader starting to develop an interest in this ancient form of embroidery would find this paperback book invaluable both as an explanation of techniques and as a guide to design in a more modern form. The illustrations show some beautiful examples of the use of goldwork * Merseyside Embroiderers Guild * Sept 06 For the basis of this book Ruth Chamberlin uses a sampler (pictured on the front cover) that she made and used as an aid when teaching her students how to master the different embroidery techniques. It now serves the same purpose for the readers of this book. Step-by-step she explains through text and photographs how to master the techniques used for the particular parts of her sampler, most of them worked in gold or silk thread. There is absolutely no need to embroider a full copy of her sampler, you can just learn to make leaves or teardrops or other figures and use them as you wish in your own designs. For these designs as well as for the project of the last chapter she has included templates which you can transfer on transparent paper to get you started. The different designs you'll learn to make include a decorative leaf, a golden diamond, a golden circle, three circles, a decorative lozenge and teardrops. Especially the last one I find quite impressive. The stitches you will learn to master in this book are laid stitch, trellis stitch, satin stitch, long stitch, short stitch, brick stitch and basket stitch. The step-by-step instructions of all these stitches make this book perfect for beginners as well as more experienced embroiderers to fresh up their skills. You will also learn to master couching, padding, using kid and making raised gold. In the last chapter, and to me also the most interesting one, the author guides you through a simple project, perfect for beginners. Two different designs for one project will show you what you have learned to master in this book and it'll be a great motivation to try out more projects once you have managed to complete this project. There are endless possibilities for making your very own projects as you just need a bit of imagination and a pencil to transfer it onto the fabric, choose the stitches you want to use and voila. If you decide to look at it that way I'm sure you'll agree with me that this book has opened up a whole new world of using gold in your embroidery pieces and will offer you endless possibilities. Note: Although a lot of these materials are rather hard to find and are quite expensive she has included cheaper alternatives so that especially beginners don't need to throw away money on their sample projects. Included are introductions to all the different materials and equipment needed to start with goldwork as well as careful instructions on how to make your own slate frame. * Euro-Reviews * Newsletter 65, Summer 2007 I found this book very interesting and enjoyable to read. The instructions are clear and easy to follow, the colour plates are exciting and made me feel that I must do some goldwork again. It will be a good reference book for anyone to have and I intend to get one to add to my growing library of Search Press books. Joan Walters, Launceston * West Country Embroiderers * July 10 This practical guide incorporates both embroidery and goldwork techniques, that will appeal to all abilities.

For five centuries it has taken the resources of a state to destroy another state . . . This is no longer true, owing to advances in international telecommunications, rapid computation, and weapons of mass destruction. The change in statecraft that will accompany these developments will be as profound as any that the State has thus far undergone."<br>&#x2014;from the Prologue<br><br><i>The Shield of Achilles</i> is a classic inquiry into the nature of the State, its origin in war, and its drive for peace and legitimacy. Philip Bobbitt, a professor of constitutional law and a historian of nuclear strategy, has served in the White House, the Senate, the State Department, and the National Security Council in both Democratic and Republican administrations, and here he brings his formidable experience and analytical gifts to bear on our changing world. Many have observed that the nation-state is dying, yet others have noted that the power of the State has never been greater. Bobbitt reconciles this paradox and introduces the idea of the market-state, which is already replacing its predecessor. Along the way he treats such themes as the Long War (which began in 1914 and ended in 1990). He explains the relation of violence to legitimacy, and the role of key individuals in fates that are partially&#x2014;but only partially&#x2014;determined.<br><br>This book anticipates the coalitional war against terrorism and lays out alternative futures for the world. Bobbitt shows how nations might avoid the great power confrontations that have a potential for limitless destruction, and he traces the origin and evolution of the State to such wars and the peace conferences that forged their outcomes into law, from Augsburg to Westphalia to Utrecht to Vienna to Versailles.<br><br>The author paints a powerful portrait of the ever-changing interrelatedness of our world, and he uses his expertise in law and strategy to discern the paths that statehood will follow in the coming years and decades. Timely and perceptive, <i>The Shield of Achilles</i> will change the way we think about the world.</p><p>The scope of Philip Bobbitt's <i>The Shield of Achilles</i> is breathtaking: the interplay, over the last six centuries, among war, jurisprudence, and the reshaping of countries ("states," in Bobbitt's vocabulary). Bobbitt posits that certain wars should be deemed epochal--that is, seen as composed of many "smaller" wars. For example, according to Bobbitt the epochal war of the 20th century began in 1914 and ended with the collapse of communism in 1990. These military affairs--and their subsequent "ultimate" peace agreements--have caused, each in their own way, revolutionary reconstructions of the idea and actuality of statehood and, following, of relationships between these various new entities. Of these reconstructions (including the princely state, the kingly state, and the nation-state), Bobbitt is most interested in the current incarnation, which he calls the market-state: one whose borders are scuffed and hazy at best (certainly compared to earlier territorial markers) and whose strengths, weaknesses, citizens, and enemies roam across cyberspace rather than plains and valleys. <i>The Shield of Achilles</i> is massive, erudite, and demanding--at once highly abstract and extremely detailed. There is about it an air of detached erudition, one noticeably free of the easy "decline and fall" hysteria too often present in contemporary historical analyses. <i>--H. O'Billovich</i>&#x201c;Magisterial in its scope and ambition. . . .

During the excavation of the Upper Paleolithic site known as Doln� V?estonice, they found a pair of shoulder blades from a mammoth. The bones had been placed so as to form the two sides of a pitched roof, one of them leaning against the other. Beneath them was a human skeleton, and in the earth that covered it and on the bones themselves were traces of red ocher. The body had been painted red before it was laid to rest.<br><br>If nothing more had been found in this grave, it would have added little to what was already known about Ice Age peoples and their customs. During the Upper Paleolithic, corresponding to the final years of the Ice Age, about sixty thousand years ago, people already had the same anatomy as modern human beings. In Eurasia, most of them lived not in caves but in the dark coniferous forests and wide-open steppes that lay beyond the reach of the glaciers.<br><br>This particular burial was of no ordinary person, though. A flint spearhead had been placed near the head of the deceased, and the body of a fox had been placed in one hand. For the archaeological team, led by Bohuslav Kl�ma, the fox was a clear indication that the person in the grave had been a shaman; the fox had a long history as a shamanic spirit guide, in Europe and all the way across Asia and into the Americas. It came as something of a shock, however, when skeletal analysis revealed that the shaman in question was a woman.<br><br>Why is this find so important? Before the discovery of this woman&#x2014;and, though it&#x2019;s hard to believe, for a long time afterward&#x2014;Ice Age shamans were imagined as members of an all-male religious community of mammoth hunters, a sort of Flintstones private club in which manhood was celebrated and the transcendental achieved by worshiping, then negating, the feminine. This excavation&#x2014;which remains the oldest known of its kind&#x2014;and further work at Doln� V?estonice prove that wasn&#x2019;t so.<br><br>A few years later, near the shaman&#x2019;s grave, Kl�ma discovered an earthen lodge containing a number of bone flutes and a large oven filled with nearly three thousand small pieces of baked clay. Some pieces had been molded in the shape of human feet, hands, and heads, while others were fragments of animal figurines. According to the archaeologist, &#x201c;this bake-oven is the predecessor of the potter&#x2019;s kiln, serving for the hardening and firing of the oldest known ceramic productions.&#x201d;1<br><br>In other words, not only do the oldest known skeletal remains of a shaman belong to a woman, but she is also the earliest known artisan who worked in clay and then hardened it with fire. She wasn&#x2019;t making early household utensils; no, she seems to have been making talismans or figurines of some sort, perhaps for use in her rituals and spiritual healing.<br><br>How has it happened that we&#x2019;ve lost sight of this ancient woman shaman and what she represents? For despite the proof of language and artifacts, despite pictorial representations, ethnographic narratives, and eyewitness accounts, the importance&#x2014;no, the primacy&#x2014;of women in shamanic traditions has been obscured and denied. That women&#x2019;s bodies and minds are particularly suited to tap into the power of the transcendental has been ignored. The roles that women have played in healing and prophecy throughout human history have been denigrated. All too often women who enter medicine or the ministry still believe they&#x2019;re stepping into a strictly men&#x2019;s field; in fact, these are historically women&#x2019;s fields that men have since entered. Women have been characterized as mere artisans or craftspeople&#x2014;weavers and potters&#x2014;instead of recognized for the creative, life- giving, cosmos-shaping powers these arts represent. Why? The reasons undoubtedly range from misreading of research to sexism pure and simple. But it&#x2019;s time to take another look at the evidence of millennia and of cultures around the globe. It&#x2019;s time to reclaim the woman in the shaman&#x2019;s body.<br><br><b>GRANDMOTHER&#x2019;S WISDOM</b><br><br>My interest in women as healers and mystics goes back to my childhood. I well remember the late fall mornings I spent at my grandmother&#x2019;s place on the prairie of Saskatchewan. She was an Ojibwe, and her two-room home was built from hewn jack pine logs chinked with mud. The roof consisted of round poles covered with moss and mud. Outside there were tall grasses and wild berries everywhere, and I would accompany her into the woods to gather the special fruits, flowers, twigs, and roots she needed to make her strange and mysterious healing concoctions.<br><br>As we followed the narrow trails that only my grandmother knew, she pointed out each edible plant: chokecherries, cranberries, gooseberries, blackberries, raspberries, violets, mints, chickweed, and all kinds of mushrooms. As we sat on boulders by the side of a stream, she told me stories handed down by her people&#x2014;tales about Old Lady Nokomis, the owner of herbs, and her grandson Nanabush the shape-shifter, who changed at will from a tree trunk to an entire willow tree, then into a beaver, a deer, or a fluffy white cloud; stories about witches called &#x201c;bear-walkers&#x201d; who traveled about at night inside glowing balls of light.<br><br>My grandmother&#x2014;whose name was also Nokomis&#x2014;was raised and practiced as an herbalist and a midwife among Anglo-Canadians as well as with Ojibwe and Cree peoples. Her first husband, like herself, was a member of the group of healing shamans known in English as the Great Medicine Lodge, or in Ojibwe as the Midewiwin, meaning &#x201c;mystic drum doings.&#x201d; She bore him five children before he died; then to support herself she traveled around the provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba visiting schools, churches, and community centers and teaching herbal healing, storytelling, and massage to anyone who was interested.<br><br>For &#x201c;selling&#x201d; her traditional knowledge, and for healing whites as well as natives, her relatives disapproved of her. My cousins called her a witch and ran whenever they caught sight of her long braid dangling over her basket, which overflowed with peculiar roots and leaves.<br><br>Even though she often dressed in black&#x2014;she wore a long-sleeved blouse, ankle-length skirt, and black shawl with purple fringe&#x2014;I knew she was neither a witch nor a sorcerer. Her medicine was good, not evil.<br><br>But now I&#x2019;ve come to think perhaps she was a witch&#x2014;in beaded moccasins. After all, women healers long ago were known as &#x201c;witches,&#x201d; a word that came from Old English witan, which meant &#x201c;to know&#x201d; or &#x201c;to be wise.&#x201d; Like my grandmother, witches were the wise women who had a special knack for revealing life&#x2019;s mysterious truths. I still remember her explaining that our thoughts and emotions overlap and intermingle, and that this mixing of head and heart connects us to future events hidden in the dark womb of time.<br><br>My grandmother was a nonconformist, and as her second husband she chose a Scots-Irish traveling salesman whose life she had saved after a moose-hunting accident. By treating his wound she earned not only his gratitude but also his deep affection, and together they had six children.<br><br>My mother was the youngest of them, and she had no interest in learning traditional ways. She left for college and afterward married my Irish-American father. A short time later I was born.<br><br>Despite my mother&#x2019;s attempt to distance herself from her heritage, I loved to spend summers with my grandmother. She greeted my curiosity about the spirit world with respect and encouraged my questions. And she asked me about my dreams.<br><br><b>DREAM PROPHECY</b><br><br>One day when I was four I told her a dream in which a tiny spotted turtle swam across the pond toward me, slithered out of the water, and plopped down beside me on a log. My dream was lucky, she explained, for Turtle was a spiritual being, a healing manito. He had picked me out and brought me a message: One day I would follow him as a healer.<br><br>That winter my parents moved to Washington, DC, where I was stricken with poliomyelitis. When my mother called her, my grandmother already knew that I was seriously ill and was preparing to come to my bedside. As I lay paralyzed inside the iron lung, she sat with me, singing songs and knitting socks and mittens for her other grandchildren.<br><br>She brought me a beautiful black and gold turtle amulet she had beaded, and hung it on the corner of the mirror suspended above my head. &#x201c;Now, when you look into the mirror you will see your face with Turtle. And then you will know who you really are,&#x201d; she whispered (figure 1).<br><br>Eventually she convinced my parents that warm water, herbs, and gentle massage were a better treatment for my nonfunctioning muscles than immobilization in an iron lung. They finally agreed, demanded my release from my iron carapace, and brought me home to a regimen of daily swims, sweat baths, and my grandmother&#x2019;s herbal compresses and therapeutic massage, which sent bolts of electricity through my paralyzed limbs. In a few months I had recovered enough strength and flexibility to go to school, albeit with metal leg braces.<br><br>By the time I was a freshman at the University of California at Berkeley, my leg muscles had recovered so thoroughly that I had only the tiniest limp. I studied and enjoyed myself like any other college student, and tried not to think about my grandmother&#x2019;s lessons&#x2014;until one night she appeared to me in a dream.<br><br>I was in a misty wood where long silken tendrils hung from the branches and hid my grandmother&#x2019;s figure. Suddenly she said, &#x201c;Step where I step.&#x201d; And, although I could not see her clearly, I followed her purple-fringed shawl up and up into the chilly night sky. At dawn we arrived at a large, messy nest filled wit...</p><h2>Flip, Float, Fly</h2><p>Maple seeds twirling in the wind, tumbleweeds rolling across the prairie, burdock seeds sticking to socks, coconuts drifting across the ocean, fig seeds falling to the ground in bat droppings, and acorns buried by forgetful squirrels are some of the examples used here to introduce methods of seed distribution.

Using images from works-paintings, photographs, lithographs, etchings, sketches-found in London's National Portrait Gallery, <em>The Face of Britain</em> weaves together an account of their composition, framed by their particular moment of creation, and in the process unveils a collective portrait of nation and its history.<br><br>"Portraits," Schama writes, "have always been made with an eye to posterity." Commissioned to paint Winston Churchill in 1954, Graham Sutherland struggled with how to capture the "savior" of Great Britain honestly and humanely. Schama calls the portrait, initially damned, the "most powerful image of a Great Briton ever executed." Annie Leibovitz's photograph of a nude John Lennon kissing Yoko Ono, taken five hours before his murder, bears "a weight of poignancy she could not possibly have anticipated." Hans Holbein's preparatory sketch for a portrait of Henry VIII depicts "an unstoppable engine of dynastic generation." Here are expressions from across the centuries of normalcy and heroism, beauty and disfigurement, aristocracy and deprivation, the familiar and the obscure-the faces of courtesans, warriors, workers, activists, playwrights, the high and mighty as well as pub-crawlers. Linking them is Schama's vibrant exploration of how their connective power emerges from the dynamic between subject and artist, work and viewer, time and place. <br><br>Schama's compelling analysis and impassioned evocation of these works create an unforgettable verbal mosaic that at once reveals and transforms the images he places before us. Lavishly illustrated and written with the storytelling brio that is Schama's trademark, <em>The Face of Britain</em> invites us to look at a nation's visual legacies and find its reflection.<br></p><p><br><strong>Simon Schama</strong> is Professor of History and Art History at Columbia University and the author of many books, including <em>Rough Crossings</em>, which won the National Book Critics Circle Award for nonfiction, and <em>The Embarrassment of Riches</em>. He is a Contributing Editor to the <em>Financial Times</em> for which he writes on politics and culture and has written and presented more than fifty documentaries for the BBC, PBS, and the History Channel, including <em>The Power of Art</em>, which won the 2007 International Emmy for Best Arts Programming.<br><br>"...unfailingly amusing and intermittently risque, delivered with smooth, slightly ironic panache." -<em>Foreign Affairs</em><p></p><br>"This splendid book by historian and art critic Simon Schama could hardly be better timed since it might plausibly be argued that 'the face of Britain' changed on or about June 23, 2016." -Christopher Benfey, <em>The New York Times Book Review</em> <br><p></p><br>"He knows the history, the biography, and the art history... he made me look and learn. He is a great storyteller and we learn something new on every page." -A. S. Byatt, <em>New Statesman</em> <br><p></p><br>"All of these lives rendered with an acuity of detail that could rival the best of portraitists ... describing Lawrence's portrait of Wilberforce, Schama calls the painting a work of 'transforming empathy.' That phrase could be true of his storytelling throughout this book." -Ekow Eshun, <em>The</em> <em>Independent</em> <br><p></p><br>"Simon Schama's richly illustrated history of Britain in portraits is a work of dazzling panache ... a book to devour." -John Carey, <em>Sunday Times</em><p></p><br>"Wonderfully compelling ... what this book, full of unhackneyed paintings and unfamiliar stories, shows is that when Schama is at his best he can see straight through people." -Michael Prodger, iThe Timesr <br><p></p><br>"Rich in its variety of subjects ... poignantly memorable" -Martin Gayford, iTelegraphr<p></p><br>"Some of the best writing on British portraiture I have read." -Bendor Grosvenor, iFinancial Timesr <br><p></p><br>"He is both an inspired communicator of detail and context, an excitable and exciting critic and a sleeve-tugging gossip. The idea of portraiture is a perfect vehicle for his detailed imagination...the subjects of the portraits become uncannily alive." -Tim Adams, iThe Observerr<p></p><br>"He has animated our portraits superlatively.

Still only half conscious, he wasn&#x2019;t able to figure out who was talking, much less make sense of what they were talking about, but he was aware enough to be disturbed by their predatory tone. <br>&#x201c;I think we should trade them,&#x201d; a second man said as he tightened the knot in the rope he had looped around Richard&#x2019;s ankles. <br>&#x201c;Trade them?&#x201d; the first asked in a heated voice. &#x201c;Look at the bloody blankets they were wrapped in and the blood all over the floor of the wagon. They&#x2019;d likely die before we could ever trade them, and then they&#x2019;d go to waste. Besides, how could we carry them both? The horses for their soldiers and the wagon are all gone, along with anything else of value.&#x201d; <br>The second man let out an unhappy sigh. &#x201c;Then we should eat the big one before anyone else shows up. We could carry the smaller one easier and then trade her.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Or save her and eat her later.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d be better off trading her. When else would we ever get a chance like this to get as much as she would fetch?&#x201d; <br>As the two men argued, Richard tried to reach out to the side to touch Kahlan lying close up against him, but he couldn&#x2019;t. He realized that his wrists were bound tightly together with a coarse rope. He instead pushed at her with his elbow. She didn&#x2019;t respond. <br>Richard knew that he needed to do something, but he also knew that he would first need to summon not just his senses, but his strength, or he would have no chance. He felt worse than weak. He felt feverish with an inner sickness that had not only drained his strength but left his mind in a numb fog. <br>He lifted his head a little and squinted in the dim light, trying to see, trying to get his bearings, but he couldn&#x2019;t really make out much of anything. When his head pushed up against something, he realized that he and Kahlan were covered with a stiff tarp. Out under the bottom edge he could see a pair of vague, dark silhouettes at the end of the wagon beyond his feet. One man stepped closer and lifted the bottom of the tarp while the other looped a rope around Kahlan&#x2019;s ankles and tied it tight, the way they had done with Richard. <br>Through that opening Richard could see that it was night. The full moon was up, but its light had a muted quality to it that told him the sky was overcast. A slow drizzle drifted through the still air. Beyond the two figures a murky wall of spruce trees rose up out of sight. <br>Kahlan didn&#x2019;t move when Richard pushed his elbow a little more forcefully against her ribs. Her hands, like his, lay nested at her belt line. His worry about what might be wrong with her had him struggling to gather his senses. He could see that she was at least breathing, although each slow breath was shallow. <br>As he gradually regained consciousness, Richard realized that besides feeling weak with fever of some sort, he hurt all over from hundreds of small wounds. Some of them still oozed blood. He could see that Kahlan was covered with the same kinds of cuts and puncture wounds. Her clothes were soaked in blood. <br>But it was not only the blood on the two of them that worried him. Damp air rolling in under the tarp carried an even heavier smell of blood from out beyond the men. There had been people with them, people who had come to help them. His level of alarm rose past his ability to gather his strength. <br>Richard could feel the lingering effects of being healed, and he recognized the shadowy touch of the woman who had been healing him, but since he still ached from cuts and bruises, he knew that while the healing had been started, it hadn&#x2019;t gone beyond that start, much less been completed. <br>He wondered why. <br>On his other side, the side away from Kahlan, he heard something dragged across the floor of the wagon. <br>&#x201c;Look at this,&#x201d; the man with the gruff voice said as he pulled it out. For the first time, Richard could see the size of the man&#x2019;s muscled arms as he reached in and lifted the object he had dragged closer. <br>The other man let out a low whistle. &#x201c;How could they have missed that? For that matter, how could they have missed these two?&#x201d; <br>The bigger man glanced around. &#x201c;Messy as everything looks, it must have been the Shun-tuk.&#x201d; <br>The other&#x2019;s voice lowered with sudden concern. &#x201c;Shun-tuk? You really think so?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;From what I know of their ways, I&#x2019;d say it was them.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What would the Shun-tuk be doing out here?&#x201d; <br>The big man leaned toward his companion. &#x201c;Same as us. Hunting for those with souls.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;This far from their homeland? That seems unlikely.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;With the barrier wall now breached, what better place to hunt for people with souls? The Shun-tuk would go anywhere, do anything, to find such people. Same as us.&#x201d; He lifted an arm around in a quick gesture. &#x201c;We came out to hunt these new lands, didn&#x2019;t we? So would the Shun-tuk.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But they have a vast domain. Are you sure they would venture out?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Their domain may be vast and they may be powerful, but the thing they want most they don&#x2019;t have. With the barrier wall breached they can hunt for it, now, the same as us, the same as others.&#x201d; <br>The other man&#x2019;s gaze darted about. &#x201c;Even so, their domain is distant. Do you really think it could be them? This far out from their homeland?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never encountered the Shun-tuk myself, and I hope not to.&#x201d; The big man raked his thick fingers back through his wet, stringy hair as he scanned the dark line of trees. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;ve heard that they hunt other half people just for the practice until they can find those with souls. <br>&#x201c;This looks like their way. They usually hunt at night. With prey out in the open like this, they strike fast and hard with overwhelming numbers. Before anyone has time to see them coming, or to react, it&#x2019;s over. They usually eat some of those they fall upon, but they take most for later.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Then what about these two? Why would they leave them?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;They wouldn&#x2019;t. In their rush to eat some of those they captured and to take the rest back with them, they must have missed these two hidden under the tarp.&#x201d; <br>The smaller man picked at a splinter at the end of the wagon bed for a moment as he carefully scanned the countryside. &#x201c;I hear it told that Shun-tuk often come back to check for returning stragglers.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You heard true.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Then we should be away from here in case they come back. Once they are overcome with the blood lust, they would devour us without hesitation.&#x201d; <br>Richard felt powerful fingers grip his ankle. &#x201c;I thought you wanted to eat this one before he dies and his soul can leave him.&#x201d; <br>The other man took hold of Richard&#x2019;s other ankle. &#x201c;Maybe we should take him to a safe place, first, where the Shun-tuk wouldn&#x2019;t be so likely to come across us and interfere. I would hate to be surprised once we get started. We can get a good price for the other. There be those who would pay anything for one with a soul. Even the Shun-tuk would bargain for such a person.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a dangerous idea.&#x201d; He thought it over briefly. &#x201c;But you&#x2019;re right, the Shun-tuk would pay a fortune.&#x201d; The wolfish hunger was back in the bigger man&#x2019;s voice. &#x201c;This one, though, is mine.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s plenty for both of us.&#x201d; <br>The other grunted. He seemed already lost in private cravings. &#x201c;But only one soul.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It belongs to the one who devours it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Enough talk,&#x201d; the big man growled. &#x201c;I want at him.&#x201d; <br>As Richard was dragged out of the wagon, he was still struggling to gather his wits in order to make some kind of sense of the strange things he was hearing. He remembered well the warnings about the dangers of the Dark Lands. He was aware enough to realize that for the moment his life depended on not letting the two men know that he was beginning to come around. <br>As he was swiftly dragged by his ankles clear of the wagon bed, his upper body dropped to the ground. Even though he tried to round his shoulders, with his hands tied he couldn&#x2019;t use them or his arms effectively to keep his head from whacking the rocky ground. The pain was shockingly sharp, followed by an enveloping, inviting blackness that he knew would be fatal if he couldn&#x2019;t fight it off. <br>He focused on the surroundings, looking for an escape route, to try to keep his mind engaged. From what he was able to see in the murky moonlight, the wagon sat alone and desolate in the wilderness. The horses were gone. <br>While he didn&#x2019;t see anyone else about, he did spot bones nearby. The bones were not bleached by weather, but stained dark with dried blood and bits of flesh. He could see gouges where teeth tried to scrape every bit of tissue from the bones. <br>The bones were human. <br>He recognized, too, shreds of uniforms. They were the uniforms of the First File, his personal bodyguards. Some of them, at least, had apparently given their lives defending Richard and Kahlan. <br>The smaller man still had hold of Richard&#x2019;s ankle, apparently unwilling to let go of his prize. The other man stood to the side, looking at the thing he had pulled across the floor and out of the wagon. <br>Richard realized that it was his sword. <br>The man holding the sword pulled Kahlan partway out from under the tarp. Her lower legs bent at the knees and swung lifelessly from the end of the wagon bed. <br>While the man was distracted looking at her, Richard used the opportunity to sit up and lunge, trying to snatch his sword. The man yanked it back out of the way before Richard could get his fingers around the hilt. With his hands and feet tied, he hadn&#x2019;t been free enough to grab it in time. <br>Both men stepped back. They hadn&#x2019;t thought he was conscious. Richard had lost the advantage of surprise and gained nothing in return. <br>In reaction to seeing him awake, both men decided not to waste any more time. Snarling like hungry wolves, they descended on him, attacking him like animals in a feeding frenzy. The situation was so bizarre that it was difficult to believe. <br>The smaller of the two pulled Richard&#x2019;s shirt open. Richard could see a glaze of ferocious savagery in the man&#x2019;s eyes. The bigger one, teeth bared with a feral fury, dove straight for the side of Richard&#x2019;s neck. Richard reflexively drew his shoulder up, deflecting the lunge at the last instant. In protecting his exposed neck, the move instead presented his shoulder to the attack. <br>Richard screamed out in pain as teeth sank into his upper arm. He knew that he had to do something, and do it quick. <br>He could think of only one thing: his gift. He mentally reached down deep within, desperately summoning deadly forces, urgently calling on the power that was his birthright. <br>Nothing happened. <br>With his level of anger and desperation, along with his fear for Kahlan, the essentials were there for his gift to respond. In the past it had answered such critical need. The power of it should have come roaring forth. <br>It was as if there was no gift there to summon. <br>Unable to call it forth, with his wrists and ankles bound, he had no effective way to fight off the two men. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by Terry Goodkind <br></p><h2>Credo</h2><p><p>William Sloane Coffin challenged the nation with his passionate calls for social justice. In this best-seller, Coffin gives a powerful record of his remarkable public life, offering his inspiring words on issues ranging from charity and justice to politics and the meaning of faith.</p></p><p>This collection of inspiring credos by William Sloane Coffin melds Christian spirit with social justice. Coffin's credentials are impressive--he served as chaplain of Yale University and Williams College, and he is the inspiration for the character Rev. Sloan in the <i>Doonesbury</i> comic strip. He is also a lifelong social crusader and peace activist. In James Carroll's exquisite introduction he recalls a night in 1972 when he and Coffin and numerous other ministers were thrown in jail for trespassing at the U.S. Capitol (while protesting the war in Vietnam). It was Coffin's baritone voice that broke the jailhouse silence, singing out Handel's "Messiah" and comforting the frightened men of the cloth. In fact, Coffin, author of <i>The Heart is a Little to the Left</i> has never been afraid to speak or sing out his beliefs. "I like to believe that I am an American patriot who loves his country enough to address her flaws," he states in the preface. "Today these are many, and all preachers worth their salt need fearlessly to insist that 'God 'n' Country' is not one word." <p> Editor Stephanie Egnotovich reviewed a lifetime of Coffin's sermons and unpublished speeches and then excerpted and organized them into categories. His words and her editing created a book that is full of quotables. For example:</p><blockquote> On Social Justice and Economic Rights: "In the United States grim poverty is a tragedy that great wealth makes a sin."<p> On Social Justice and Civil Liberties: "Prejudice disfigures the observer, not the person observed. If only the latter could remember it."</p><p> On Patriotism: "All nations make decisions based on self-interest and then defend them in the name of morality."</p><p> On War and Peace: "We are beginning to resemble extinct dinosaurs who suffered from too much armor and too little brain." </p></blockquote> For the leftist leaning Christian, this is the book you'll want to take on your next spiritual retreat, political protest, or any situation where left-leaning Christians gather to create social change. And when it's not being carted around in a satchel, it deserves a permanent residence on your lifelong spiritual contemplations bookshelf. --<i>Gail Hudson</i>Recently, Bill Coffin has appeared on NOW with Bill Moyers and numberous NPR programs across the country, as well as been interviewed or reviewed in the Boston Globe, The Nation, The Washington Post, The New Yorker, The Christian Century, The Bloomsbury Review, and The New York Times.</p><h2>Sharks and Other Creatures of the Deep</h2><p>Features more than 80 of the world&#39;s scariest, ugliest sharks, leeches, alligators, squid, and other underwater creatures.

It is a fine example of his Christ-centredness and his mix of theological rigour and pastoral concern. In it he aims to show from Scripture that, in all his heavenly majesty, Christ is not now aloof from believers and unconcerned, but has the strongest affections for them. <br><br>Goodwin begins with the beautiful assurances given by Christ to his disciples, taking as an example of that love Christ's washing of his disciples' feet (John 13). The heart of his argument, however, lies in his exposition of Hebrews 4:15, in which Goodwin shows that in all his glorious holiness in heaven, Christ is not sour towards his people; if anything, his capacious heart beats more strongly than ever with tender love for them. And in particular, two things stir his compassion: our afflictions and almost unbelievably our sins. <br><br> <i>How we need Goodwin and his message today! If we are to be drawn from jaded, anxious thoughts of God and a love of sin, we need such a knowledge of Christ.</i></p><p>Thomas Goodwin was born in 1600 in the small village of Rollesby in Norfolk. His parents were God-fearing, and at that time the Norfolk Broads were well-soaked in Puritanism, so unsurprisingly he grew up somewhat religious. That all wore off, though, when he went up to Cambridge as a student. There he divided his time between 'making merry' and setting out to become a celebrity preacher. He wanted, he later said, to be known as one of 'the great wits' of the pulpit, for his 'master-lust' was the love of applause.<br><br> Then in 1620 having just been appointed a fellow of Katharine Hall he heard a funeral sermon that actually moved him, making him deeply concerned for his spiritual state. It started seven grim years of moody introspection as he grubbed around inside himself for signs of grace. Only when he was told to look outwards not to trust to anything in himself, but to rest on Christ alone only then was he free.<br><br>The last twenty years of his life he spent pastoring, writing treatises, and studying in London (the study sadly interrupted in 1666 when the Great Fire burned more than half of his voluminous library). Then, at eighty years of age, he was gripped by a fatal fever. With his dying words he captured what had always been his chief concerns: 'I am going', he said, <br><br> <i>to the three Persons, with whom I have had communion . . . My bow abides in strength. Is Christ divided? No, I have the whole of his righteousness; I am found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but the righteousness which is of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ, who loved me, and gave himself for me. Christ cannot love me better than he doth. I think I cannot love Christ better than I do; I am swallowed up in God . . . Now I shall be ever with the Lord.'</i>'Thomas Goodwin (1600-1680) was one of the foremost Puritans and needs no commendation from us. In an age of much superficiality we could do little better than acquaint ourselves with such writers. Surely those of us who seek encouragement and assurance can do no better than focus on the heart of Christ.' --<i>Wilfred A. Weale</i></p><h2>Bicycle: The History</h2><p><p>During the nineteenth century, the bicycle evoked an exciting new world in which even a poor person could travel afar and at will. But was the &#x201c;mechanical horse&#x201d; truly destined to usher in a new era of road travel or would it remain merely a plaything for dandies and schoolboys? In <i>Bicycle: The History </i>(named by <i>Outside</i> magazine as the #1 book on bicycles), David Herlihy recounts the saga of this far-reaching invention and the passions it aroused. The pioneer racer James Moore insisted the bicycle would become &#x201c;as common as umbrellas.&#x201d; Mark Twain was more skeptical, enjoining his readers to &#x201c;get a bicycle. You will not regret it&#x2014;if you live.&#x201d;<br><br>Because we live in an age of cross-country bicycle racing and high-tech mountain bikes, we may overlook the decades of development and ingenuity that transformed the basic concept of human-powered transportation into a marvel of engineering. This lively and engrossing history retraces the extraordinary story of the bicycle&#x2014;a history of disputed patents, brilliant inventions, and missed opportunities. Herlihy shows us why the bicycle captured the public&#x2019;s imagination and the myriad ways in which it reshaped our world.</p></p><p><p>A Conversation With David Herlihy</p> <p></p> <p>Q: What was the impact of the invention of the bicycle?</p> <p>A: The bicycle had a substantial technological impact. It is not an exaggeration to say that the bicycle business of the 1890s spawned the automotive industry. During the peak year of production in 1896 some three hundred firms in the United States alone produced nearly two million bicycles, and many of these companies went on to make automobiles using the same highly advanced production systems. Many automotive pioneers, including Henry Ford, started out working with bicycles. And bicycle technology also helped produce the first airplanes. The Wright brothers were bicycle mechanics; they used bicycles for wind tunnel experiments and built the Wright Flyer in their workshop.</p> <p>Q: What about the social impact of the bicycle?</p> <p>A: The bicycle changed social life in all sorts of ways�for women in particular it provided a justification to dress more sensibly and a means to travel without supervision. And in the early twentieth century, when cars were still prohibitively expensive, millions of working-class people relied on the bicycle for everyday transportation. This is still the case in the developing world. And of course the bicycle has long provided healthy and fun exercise to people of all ages and backgrounds.</p> <p>Q: You&#x2019;ve spent most of your life riding and writing about bicycles. What is it about the bicycle that has held your fascination for so long?</p> <p>A: My passion for bicycles began when I was a teenager in the 1970s, when America discovered lightweight European ten-speeds. For several years I lived in Italy, where I experienced the excitement of owning and riding a high-quality racing bike. The thrill of moving and balancing on two wheels is nearly as old as the bicycle itself�even in its crudest forms in the nineteenth century, the bicycle stirred passion and fired the imagination. It represented the spirit of the age�a determination to use technology to improve the human condition.</p>"David Herlihy is a widely recognized expert on the history of the bicycle, and this book offers the most comprehensive account to date of the bicycle and its development from a novelty for the elite to transportation for the masses. Frequently wry and always intelligent, Herlihy takes us on a marvelous tour of the bicycle&#x2019;s fascinating history."&#x2014; Peter Joffre Nye, U.S. Bicycling Hall of Fame and co-author of The Lance Armstrong Performance Program <p>"Bicycle is a fascinating book. David Herlihy is a true historian, and he has uncovered a stunning amount of new material about the history of the bicycle--at times it reads like a detective story."&#x2014; David Gordon Wilson, professor, MIT and co-author, Bicycling Science, and Human-Powered Vehicles</p></p><h2>Soul Eater, Vol. 12 (Soul Eater, 12)</h2><p>The DWMA student body is still reeling after the news that one of their own is a witch.

It began at the front corner of the repurposed cement-block warehouse in North Denver, wrapped in a neat rectangle around the side parking lot and the rear loading dock, and continued to the opposite corner of the building.</p><p>Peter Ash stepped down from the back seat of Henry Nygaard&#x2019;s big four-door pickup to pull open the rolling security gate. He kept his head on a swivel, eyes chasing from the street to the fence lines to the windows and flat rooftops of neighboring buildings.</p><p>He wore a decent secondhand armored vest and one of Henry&#x2019;s spare pistols strapped to his leg, neither one exactly hidden under an untucked flannel shirt, but not particularly visible unless someone was looking for them. Which was more or less the goal.</p><p>He could feel the warmth of the blacktop through the soles of his boots, and the late-September sun was hot on his shoulders and the back of his neck. The waistband of his pants was damp from the sweat trickling down his back.</p><p>Peter didn&#x2019;t mind. He&#x2019;d been in hotter places, wearing and carrying a lot more shit.</p><p>Deacon, the driver, pulled Henry&#x2019;s truck through the gate. Peter closed it behind them, waved to the camera mounted high on the warehouse wall, and waited to hear the magnetic lock clang shut. It wasn&#x2019;t a perfect system, but it wasn&#x2019;t bad, either.</p><p>He hopped back in the pickup for the sixty-meter run to the back of the warehouse, where it became clear to every member of the Heavy Metal Protection team that their schedule was shot.</p><p>As it turned out, it was the grow manager&#x2019;s thirtieth birthday, and the cultivation workers had gotten stoned out of their gourds at lunch. Someone had brought takeout tacos and a chocolate layer cake and things had gone downhill from there. The workers sat on cheap vinyl chairs, leaning back against the white-painted block wall, eyes closed, faces raised to the afternoon sun like potted plants.</p><p>&#x201c;You got to be kidding me,&#x201d; Deacon said. &#x201c;Nap time? Ten to one says they&#x2019;re not ready for us.&#x201d;</p><p>He hit the horn and the grow manager popped out of his chair like a jack-in-the-box, standing even before he was fully awake.</p><p>In the front passenger seat, Henry looked at his watch. It was big and sturdy and dependable, just like Henry. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re okay,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll make up time on the freeway.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Y&#x2019;all are dreaming,&#x201d; said Banjo, the youngest. &#x201c;Rush hour gonna kill us.&#x201d;</p><p>The other men wore sidearms, too, and armored vests under light shirts.

They left the long guns in the truck unless absolutely necessary, because they attracted too much attention.</p><p>Peter didn&#x2019;t say anything.</p><p>He had only worked for Heavy Metal Protection for a few days, doing a favor for Henry.</p><p>None of them wanted to do the job in the dark.</p><p>They were all thinking about what had happened the week before.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Peter was tall and rangy, muscle and bone, nothing extra. He had wide, knuckly hands and a lean, angular face, his dark hair long enough to cover the tips of his slightly pointed ears. He had the thoughtful eyes of a werewolf a week before the change.</p><p>Even out in the parking lot, he could smell the heady green funk of the growing plants.</p><p>Henry said it was bad form to call it marijuana unless you were talking about medical marijuana, which was a legal term. For many people in the industry, the word &#x201c;marijuana&#x201d; had racist undertones from the first attempts to regulate the plant in the 1930s, when officials tied its recreational use to Mexican immigrants.</p><p>The Latin name for the plant&#x2019;s genus was&nbsp;<i>Cannabis</i>, the industry&#x2019;s preferred term.</p><p>And it was definitely an industry.</p><p>Call it weed, ganja, bud, or chronic, it made billions of dollars each year.</p><p>And Heavy Metal Protection was part of it. The company provided secure facility consulting, uniformed static guards for at-risk sites, and armed mobile protection for moving cash and product from point A to point B.</p><p>The mobile protection arm was nothing like an armored-car service. An armored car was a giant rolling strongbox, painted in bright colors, and made an excellent target. Heavy Metal&#x2019;s invisible, late-model civilian rides had no logos. The two-person teams were armed and wore ballistic vests but no uniforms. They looked like accountants or electricians, anyone but who they were: highly trained former military personnel with a job to do.</p><p>Most cannabis-related crime occurred at grow facilities, because they were usually located in neglected or industrial areas where the rent was cheap and traffic minimal, and also because you could find them with your nose.</p><p>Growers told their employees not to be heroes. Even if cured product was as good as cash, worth more than a thousand dollars a pound wholesale, two or three times that broken down for retail, nobody needed to die to protect a pound of weed.</p><p>But when security was done properly, with hardened facilities, visible security measures, and varied delivery schedules, robberies were rare.</p><p>Problems generally happened for one of several reasons. A security lapse, like a door left open at the end of the shift because somebody&#x2019;s magic brownie kicked in earlier than planned. A nighttime smash-and-grab on a small new facility that assumed, incorrectly, that nobody knew where that funky smell was coming from. Or something as simple as a guy walking in like he belonged, grabbing a pound or two of vacu-packed product, tucking it under his arm like a football, and taking off like O.J. at the airport.</p><p>What had happened the week before was different, a new and much larger problem.</p><p>Heavy Metal had lost an entire vehicle, its crew and cargo.</p><p>Literally, lost.</p><p>As in, could not be found.</p><p>Two men and a Dodge Dakota. One of the men was the company&#x2019;s cofounder, Henry&#x2019;s son-in-law. The other was the company&#x2019;s operations manager. Their cargo was three hundred thousand dollars in cash, gross profits headed for the client&#x2019;s cash stash in the mountains. The vehicle&#x2019;s GPS tracker had dropped off-line somewhere on I-70 headed west. The men&#x2019;s phone signals had disappeared.</p><p>No sign of any of them since.</p><p>Peter had asked the question his first day on the job. &#x201c;Did they get hit? Or just run with it?&#x201d;</p><p>Henry didn&#x2019;t comment. He glowered darkly out the windshield, as if all his suspicions about his son-in-law had been confirmed.</p><p>&#x201c;They could have run with it,&#x201d; said Deacon, shrugging a thick shoulder. &#x201c;Maybe I got a dim view of human nature.&#x201d;</p><p>Banjo shook his head. &#x201c;Had to be a hijacking,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Three hundred grand isn&#x2019;t enough to fuck up your life and turn yourself into a fugitive.&#x201d;</p><p>With no evidence either way, what had happened was anyone&#x2019;s guess. The state police had been looking into it for a week. Officially it was considered armed robbery and a possible double homicide.</p><p>But it wasn&#x2019;t going to happen again.</p><p>Today, they had another big payload. Henry had brought the heavy crew, four capable men, their heads on a swivel in the Mile-High City, sweating behind razor wire under the hot September sun.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Henry stepped down to get the grow manager moving. Deacon stayed with the truck. Banjo jogged back to the gate, where he had a view on three sides. Peter jogged forward to the opposite corner of the building, where his own three-sided view completed the perimeter.</p><p>They&#x2019;d all had duty like this before.</p><p>Peter hadn&#x2019;t thought the work would be a problem for him. He&#x2019;d been the tip of the spear for eight long years, a Marine lieutenant with more combat deployments than he cared to remember. He&#x2019;d been done with his war for a while now, but the war wasn&#x2019;t quite done with&nbsp;him. It had left him with a souvenir. An oddball form of post--traumatic stress that showed up as claustrophobia, an intense reaction to enclosed spaces. He called it the white static.</p><p>It hadn&#x2019;t showed up until he was back home, just days from mustering out.</p><p>At first, going inside was just uncomfortable. A fine-grained sensation at the back of his neck, like electric foam, or a small battery inserted under the skin. If he stayed inside, the feeling would intensify. The foam would turn to sparks, a crackling unease in his brainstem, a profound dissonance just at the edge of hearing. His neck would tense, and his shoulders would begin to rise as the muscles tightened. He&#x2019;d look for the exits as his chest clamped up, then he&#x2019;d start having trouble catching his breath. After twenty minutes, he&#x2019;d be in a full-blown panic attack, hyperventilating, his fight-or-flight mechanism cranked into overdrive.</p><p>He&#x2019;d been working on the static pretty steadily since spring. He&#x2019;d joined a veterans&#x2019; group, had been talking to a shrink. His friendship with Henry was a big part of that. He&#x2019;d been making progress. He could be inside for more than an hour now.</p><p>But there was something about sweating inside the armor again, strapping on a sidearm, the familiar feel of the AR-15 in his hand. He was losing ground. He&#x2019;d been having trouble sleeping since he&#x2019;d gotten to Denver. He told himself it was just the noise of the city, but he knew better.</p><p>He&#x2019;d told Henry he could give him a week, maybe two. No more than that.</p><p>Peter had other plans. Better plans. There was a woman he needed to see again. There was something between them, he hoped. Something real.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Heat floated up from the parking lot, turning the chain-link fence into a shimmering abstraction. Peter kept his eyes moving, searching the roads and driveways, the windows and rooftops of the neighboring buildings.</p><p>Out of habit, the way another man might tap his pockets for his keys and wallet and phone before leaving the house, Peter touched his fingertips to the butt of the pistol Henry had loaned him for the job.</p><p>It was a Sig Sauer&nbsp;.40, an older high-performance weapon unremarkable except for its pristine condition. Everything Henry owned had the patina of long use and meticulous care. His truck was from the late nineties, but it looked like new, except for the creases on the leather seats.</p><p>Henry was over seventy years old, although you&#x2019;d never think it to look at him, standing tall, his shoulders broad and square, a stubby Honduran cigar unlit in the corner of his mouth. His voice was a hoarse whisper, but it just made the other men lean in closer to hear him.</p><p>By the time Henry signed the paperwork, carried ten cardboard boxes with labels and security tape out of the facility, and loaded them into the heavy steel toolbox bolted to the bed of his pickup, they were more than an hour behind schedule.</p><p>Peter saw Henry pat his chest over his shirt pocket, as if making sure his pen was still there, before waving Peter and Banjo back to the truck.</p><p>&#x201c;Mount up,&#x201d; he called, his hoarse whisper somehow still carrying across the parking lot in that thin mountain air. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re burning daylight.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Heavy Metal team rolled onto the streets of North Denver, Henry&#x2019;s pickup looking like a hundred others around them. Their next stop was Denver&#x2019;s Finest Kind, a recreational cannabis retail shop in Curtis Park.</p><p>Peter had always thought of Denver as a mountain city, but it stood on the High Plains, straddling the Platte River, nothing but dry farmland to the east for five hundred miles and more.</p><p>To the immediate west of Denver, though, was the whole of the Rocky Mountains, rising to the sky like white-tipped teeth. They gave the city a definite flavor. Peter could see the Front Range and its foothills from many parts of the city, just looking down the broad avenues. Denver had a busy, frontier feeling, a growing city constantly reinventing itself like the rest of the Mountain West.</p><p>A block out from Denver&#x2019;s Finest Kind, Deacon drove a recon route, looking for trouble and finding none. He parked out front like any other customer. Peter and Henry got out while Deacon and Banjo stayed with the truck. Peter kept his hands free and his eyes on the move while Henry climbed up into the bed of the truck, removed a cardboard box from the big orange toolbox, hopped down with the box under his arm, and walked the quarter-block to the retailer&#x2019;s front door.</p><p>Peter followed Henry inside. He felt the white static get louder in the back of his head.</p><p>But he&#x2019;d been practicing. He was doing fine.</p><p>The security vestibule was a small room with a vase of flowers on a tiny table, a spotless bulletproof glass window, a closed-circuit camera, and a slot to pass the customer&#x2019;s ID to the cheerful receptionist. There was also an ATM in the vestibule, because the cannabis industry ran almost entirely on cash. Henry had texted ahead to the Heavy Metal guard on-site, so the man was expecting them and buzzed them through immediately.</p><p>The interior of Denver&#x2019;s Finest Kind was sleek and modern in glass and chrome, like an Apple store or a high-end boutique, although the verdant smell of the product was strong. Behind a long, elegant display counter stood three attentive salespeople, chatting with customers about particular cannabis strains and their effects. Did you want to be energetic and creative, or calm and relaxed?</p><p>Henry walked into the back room with the manager while Peter monitored the progress of the static, watched the exits, and glanced at the inventory. He loved the names of the various strains.</p><p>Purple Haze, Buddha Sativa, Skywalker, White Rhino, Gorilla Glue, BrainBender, Agent Orange, Green Crack, Trainwreck, Blue Lightning, Ass Hat, Chocolope.</p><p>Who came up with this stuff?</p><p>Stoners, presumably.</p><p>Or people trying to appeal to stoners.</p><p>In addition to the attractive glass containers of fat green buds, the store sold hashish, THC-infused oils, and edibles, everything from the traditional pot brownie to cookies, chocolate, and hard candy.</p><p>Peter had only been in Colorado for three days. He still couldn&#x2019;t quite believe selling weed was legal. But once he started looking for them, he noticed cannabis retailers and the green cross symbol of medical marijuana everywhere. He&#x2019;d stopped for gas in Aurora and found four retail stores in his line of sight from the pump.</p><p>It was like a whole different country.</p><p>Peter wasn&#x2019;t particularly interested in getting high himself. He liked good scotch, and was happy to crack a cold beer on a hot day. But he&#x2019;d found that more than one or two drinks made it harder to handle the static.</p><p>On the other hand, some of the veterans Peter worked with smoked weed on their time off, and they said that certain strains really helped with their post-traumatic stress. The medical in marijuana. If it worked for you, Peter figured, what was the harm?<br>Thanks! <br><b>___________________________________</b><br><br> <b>Terry Blake | Product Support Specialist III<br><br>700 Nestle Way #200 | Breinigsville, PA&nbsp; 18031 Office: 610.391.4637 | Fax:&nbsp; 610.391.3980 Office Hours: &nbsp;M-F 7:30 AM - 4:00 PM rrdallentowncomp@rrd.com </b></p></p><h2>The Popcorn Book</h2><p>What popcorn is, how it&#39;s stored, and how it&#39;s cooked, plus legends and recipes.</p><p><p>Tomie dePaola (pronounced Tommy da-POW-la) is best known for his books for children.</p> <p></p> <p>He's been published for over 40 years and has written and/or illustrated nearly 250 books, including Strega Nona, 26 Fairmount Avenue,The Art Lesson, and Christmas Remembered.

While most alcoholics and addicts coming out of treatment have a recovery plan, families are often left to figure things out for themselves. In <i>It Takes a Family,</i> Debra Jay takes a fresh approach to the recovery process by making family members and friends part of the recovery team, beginning in the early stages of sobriety.<br> <br>In straightforward, compassionate language, she outlines a structured model that shows family members both how to take personal responsibility and to build a circle of support to meet the obstacles common to the first year of recovery. Together, family members address the challenges of enabling, denial, and pain while developing their communication skills through practical, easy-to-follow strategies and exercises designed to create transparency and accountability. With this invaluable guide, family members work together as they reinvent their relationships without the all-consuming dysfunction of active addiction.</p><p>Debra Jay is the coauthor of <i>Love First: A New Approach to Intervention</i>.

In the face of such grim figures, it&#x2019;s easy to toss around blame.<i> Treatment doesn&#x2019;t work. The addict isn&#x2019;t doing what she should. Doctors are the new drug pushers.</i> But the truth lies elsewhere, for the most part, and requires a new conversation.<br><br>Relapse is caused by underestimating what it takes to stay sober. Addicts, their families and society minimize what is required for successful recovery. Addicts can&#x2019;t simply think their way out of addiction. Recovery requires action. It&#x2019;s much more than leaving the drug behind, whether it is alcohol, cocaine, marijuana, heroin, pain medications or tranquilizers. Recovery is about changing behaviors, which leads to changes in thinking. It&#x2019;s about honesty and willingness and letting go of resentments. It&#x2019;s about taking a fearless look at one&#x2019;s self and the wrongs of the past. It&#x2019;s about cleaning house and making amends. Recovery is about more than abstinence; it&#x2019;s about becoming the kind of person who can engage in healthy relationships.<br><br>Abstinent without recovery, the addicted person is haunted by the past, suffers in the present and can&#x2019;t see a promising future. The control centers in the brain are being depleted by the constant internal battle not to pick up a drink or a drug. Relationships with family are frayed and getting no better. Relapse is just a matter of time.<br><br>An old adage says it best: When a heavy drinker stops drinking, he feels better. When an alcoholic stops drinking, he feels worse.&#x201d; For alcoholics and addicts to begin enjoying life again, they need to work a 12-step program of recovery, because addiction is a chronic disease that affects the mind, body and spirit. There is no cure. If we don&#x2019;t understand this basic tenet of success, we don&#x2019;t understand recovery.<br><br>When we believe treatment centers are the heart of recovery, we base our hopes and dreams upon a flawed assumption. Treatment isn&#x2019;t recovery, and clinical teams don&#x2019;t know who will stay sober and who won&#x2019;t. Stellar patients drink on the flight home and seemingly hopeless cases never drink again. Treatment staffs know what works, but no one knows who will follow directions and do what it takes to stay sober.<br><br>Recovery doesn&#x2019;t officially begin until treatment ends. It isn&#x2019;t dished out by doctors or teased out by therapists. It happens in a community and not just any community. It requires working a 12-step recovery program with other alcoholics and addicts. Recovery requires broad changes in how addicts live their lives, the kind of changes that would be tough work for anyone. They are attempting it with a brain so compromised by addiction that images of cerebral matter look like Swiss cheese. With decision-making abilities impaired and emotions turbulent, it&#x2019;s no wonder so many don&#x2019;t get very far before they crumble.<br><br>The purpose of treatment is specific. It is designed to attend to the <i>acute</i> stage of this chronic illness. Involvement with patients is relatively short. A team of professionals administer to the most intense and severe symptoms, most notably, physical, emotional and spiritual. And many do an excellent job of it. But the scorecard we use to rate the success or failure of these facilities erroneously holds them responsible for patients&#x2019; sobriety once they return home. But addiction is a <i>chronic</i> disease. There is no cure. It must be managed by working a daily 12-step program. This is something treatment centers prepare their patients to do, but cannot do for them. Many addicts don&#x2019;t follow the directions and relapse.<br><br>Misconceptions about treatment coupled with the frustration of relapse has families throwing up their hands and proclaiming, Enough! Treatment doesn&#x2019;t work!&#x201d; And once they reach this verdict, hopelessness settles in and the only question left is, Now what?&#x201d;<br><br>But what if I told you there was a group of addicted people who almost never relapse in the years following treatment. As a matter of fact, 78% never have a single relapse. Less than 15% have one relapse, but not a second. And those with more than one relapse? A whopping 7%. Not only that, but these folks are some of the most difficult addicts to treat. When I worked inpatient treatment, having them assigned to our caseload would elicit groans of despair. They&#x2019;re the worst patients!&#x201d; We knew our work just doubled.<br><br>But these patients are getting something our loved ones aren&#x2019;t: a team who works with them for five years after treatment to make sure they build a solid program of recovery and make the prerequisite changes that lead to lasting sobriety. Because when alcoholics and addicts are left to their own devices in spite of the universal cry that they can do it on their own the odds are they&#x2019;ll be drinking and drugging again.<br><br>Author Stephen King, in his column for <i>Entertainment Weekly,</i> writes about just this point:<br><br>"Managing good sobriety without much help is a trick very few druggies and alcoholics can manage. I know, because I&#x2019;m both. Substance abusers lie about everything and usually do an awesome job of it. I once knew a cokehead who convinced his girlfriend the smell of freebase was mold in the plastic shower curtain of their apartment&#x2019;s bathroom. She believed him, he said, for five years (although he was probably lying about that, it was probably only three) Go to one of those church-basement meetings where they drink coffee and talk about the Twelve Steps and you can hear similar stories on any night, and that&#x2019;s why the founders of this group emphasized complete honesty what happened, what changed, what it&#x2019;s like now If my own career as a drunk both active and sober has convinced me of anything, it&#x2019;s convinced me of this: Addictive personalities do not prosper on their own. Without unvarnished, tough-love, truth-telling from their own kind the voices that say, You&#x2019;re lying about that, Freckles&#x201d;--the addict has a tendency to fall back to his old ways."<br><br>The problem is, of course, that alcoholics and addicts don&#x2019;t want to work a program of recovery, which requires very specific actions. They&#x2019;re convinced they have changed with surprisingly little effort and in a remarkably short amount of time, and they often convince their poor gullible families of the same. Alcoholics always have a better idea, which usually entails staying sober on their own, and eventually lands them back in the liquor store or crack house or doctor&#x2019;s office looking for a script.<br><br>But what if we, as families, could initiate a program with our loved ones that models programs used by the recovery winners--those people who almost never relapse? What if we could provide the missing element that makes it much tougher to relapse? Once we appropriately define treatment as first responders, not as a stand-alone solution that does all the work for us, our expectations of treatment change. No doubt, treatment has a vital job to do, but it&#x2019;s not the only job to be done. Treatment centers can keep alcoholics and addicts only so long and then there is a hand off, sending them back home to us.<br><br>Families and close friends have a tremendous amount of influence in an alcoholic&#x2019;s life, but usually don&#x2019;t know it. As a matter of fact, families not only don&#x2019;t understand their power, but often believe they are powerless. They feel mistreated, disregarded, even hated.<br><br>The very people an alcoholic needs most are the people he fights against. Or appeases, only to break the promises made. Or ignores, pretending he simply doesn&#x2019;t care. The addiction not only abuses the people he cares about, but it abuses him. He breaks promises to himself. He pretends none of the pain matters. He begins losing everything he holds dear and can&#x2019;t stop it. He is filled with shame as he strikes out in anger. He doesn&#x2019;t understand what is happening inside himself. That&#x2019;s what it&#x2019;s like to live under the tyranny of addiction.<br><br><b>Stick With the Winners</b><br>So who are these winners who mostly never relapse in the first five years of recovery? And why do they get exceptional support that safeguards them from relapse? They are doctors. No one can imagine an opiate-addicted cardiologist or alcoholic neurosurgeon left to their own devices once discharged from treatment. If they are going to see patients, they must be sober.<br><br>Right about now, I can hear people objecting, Of course they stay sober. They&#x2019;re doctors. They know better than to relapse.&#x201d; But remember what I told you: <i>they are the toughest patients in treatment. </i>The belief that addicted doctors take direction well or commit to do what is required to stay sober is largely fictional. In truth, doctors are at even higher risk for relapse.<br><br>Let&#x2019;s put a doctor&#x2019;s risk for relapse into perspective by looking at something else they struggle with: hand washing. For the last thirty years there&#x2019;s been an ongoing effort to persuade doctors to wash their hands between seeing patients with little sustainable change. As a result, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we spend $30 billion fighting unnecessary infections in the United States every year. Almost 100,000 people die. The fix? Soap and water. Knowing this fact has not produced improved physician hygiene practices. So hospitals have been forced into action. They&#x2019;ve trained hand-washing coaches and installed video cameras that send images halfway around the world so workers in India can monitor our doctors. They require doctors to wear radio-frequency ID chips that register each time they walk by a sink. Good hand-washers are rewarded with cash.<br><br>Another false belief is that success is correlated with the fact that doctors have a medical license to lose. After all, retaining their privileges to practice medicine is a big motivator for staying sober. Most of us are concerned about loved ones who do not have the threat of losing a medical license looming over their heads. But our addicted family members have things they value too. Things they do not want to lose. Topping the list is family. With few exceptions, alcoholics and addicts love their families.<br><br>However, for most alcoholics and addicts, consequences in the distant future have little impact on what they do today. Whether it&#x2019;s someday losing a medical license or someday losing their family, the immediate pull of addiction has far greater power. The need to snort cocaine today obliterates concerns about tomorrow. Whether you are a doctor or not, the negative consequences that get your attention are the ones that happen right away, not in some far off time. A drug court in Hawaii found that the future threat of a ten year prison sentence was a poorer deterrent than being immediately sent to jail for three days upon failing a drug test. Timing of consequences is more effective than the size of a consequence.<br><br>Doctors entering treatment tend to be sicker than most due to a seemingly inexhaustible supply of drugs and the ability to more easily hide their problems from others. People look away and enable addicted doctors more than the average addict. Intervening on a doctor usually occurs only after the addiction is impossible to ignore. Consequently, addiction&#x2019;s progression is quite serious before most physicians find themselves in treatment. This makes their long-term successes all the more compelling. It appears they&#x2019;ve found the Holy Grail of recovery.<br></p><h2>Richard of St. Victor: The Book of the Patriarchs, The Mystical Ark, Book Three of the Trinity (Classics of Western Spirituality)</h2><p>One of the great mystics of the Christian Tradition, Richard is the link between the early tradition of Pseudo-Dionysius and the great mystical awakening in Medieval Europe. For his genius in bringing together both the Latin and Greek Traditions all contemplatives owe him a great debt. Born in twelfth century Scotland, he joined the Abbey of St. Victor in Paris where he became Superior and Prior. <p>The Twelve Patriarchs (or Benjamin Minor) is his preparation of the soul for contemplation. The framework is a scriptural allegory based on the story of Jacob. Richard uses the meaning of the names and the elements of the story to illustrate a unified view of the person and the relationship between contemplation and action. His Mystical Ark ( or Benjamin Major) completes this study. </p><p>In his Book Three of the Trinity we see Richard's doctrinal basis for the spiritual conclusions of his earlier work. Richard can teach us about the discipline and the dangers of the mystical quest. He can enlighten us concerning the relevance of symbols and symbolic structures as modes of communication. </p><p>Jean Chatillon, of the University of Paris, who wrote the preface, is the world's Victorine scholar.</p></p><p>Text: English, Latin (translation)</p><h2>An Uncommon Heroine: Scarlett, Edna, Sula--and More Than 20 Other of the Most Remarkable Women in Literature</h2><p><i>One is not born a woman, one becomes one.</i><br> -<b>Simone de Beauvoir</b><br><br>Literature has provided us with some of the most unforgettable women in history.

Wry, courtly, opinionated, and completely endearing, the Major leads a quiet life valuing the proper things that Englishmen have lived by for generations: honor, duty, decorum, and a properly brewed cup of tea. But then his brother's death sparks an unexpected friendship with Mrs. Jasmina Ali, the Pakistani shopkeeper from the village. Drawn together by their shared love of literature and the loss of their spouses, the Major and Mrs. Ali soon find their friendship blossoming into something more. But village society insists on embracing him as the quintessential local and regarding her as the permanent foreigner. Can their relationship survive the risks one takes when pursuing happiness in the face of culture and tradition?<br></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, March 2010</strong>: In her witty and wise debut novel, newcomer Helen Simonson introduces the unforgettable character of the widower Major Ernest Pettigrew.&nbsp; The Major epitomizes the Englishman with the "stiff upper lip," who clings to traditional values and has tried (in vain) to pass these along to his yuppie son, Roger. The story centers around Pettigrew's fight to keep his greedy relatives (including his son) from selling a valuable family heirloom--a pair of hunting rifles that symbolizes much of what he stands for, or at least what he thinks he does. The embattled hero discovers an unexpected ally and source of consolation in his neighbor, the Pakistani shopkeeper Jasmina Ali. On the surface, Pettigrew and Ali's backgrounds and life experiences couldn't be more different, but they discover that they have the most important things in common. This wry, yet optimistic comedy of manners with a romantic twist will appeal to grown-up readers of both sexes.

Now comes his final work of fiction, a subtle, concentrated culmination of his art and ideas. <br><br> For more than fifty years Gaddis collected notes for a book about the mechanization of the arts, told via a social history of the player piano in America. In the years before his death in 1998, he distilled the whole mass into a fiction, a dramatic monologue by an elderly man with a terminal illness. This "man in the bed" lies dying, thinking anxiously about the book he still plans to write, grumbling about the deterioration of civilization and trying to explain his obsession to the world before he passes away or goes mad. <br><br> <i>Agape- Agape</i> continues Gaddis's career-long reflection via the form of the novel on those aspects of the corporate technological culture that are uniquely destructive of the arts. It is a stunning achievement from one of the indisputable masters of postwar American fiction.</p><p>William Gaddis's final work, <i>Agape Agape</i>, is an effective distillation of his philosophy and a powerful personal statement regarding the state of modern culture. The book is written in the form of a disjointed, stream-of-consciousness monologue delivered by a dying elderly man, himself attempting to complete his final work, a social history of the player piano in America. Desperate to complete his work before the onset of madness or death and fighting the effects of medication, the frantic narrator offers a meandering discussion of his work, which explores technology's artistically stifling influence. The narrator has isolated a particularly profound example of this in the player piano, an artistic invention that alternately replaced the artist. Technology, the narrator argues, has heightened the value of passivity, entertainment, and mediocrity, leading to the impending "collapse of everything, of meaning, of language, of values, of art, disorder and dislocation wherever you look." The narrator fervently claims that only through artistic courage can we achieve understanding, transcendence, and discover the uniting spirit of creativity, a brotherly "agape" love.<p> As Joseph Tabbi explains in his informative afterword, <i>Agape Agape</i> is the result of years of research and consideration by Gaddis, and the novella explores technological advancement and the response to this advancement, both actual and hypothetical, by such figures as Nietzsche, Walter Benjamin, and Tolstoy. While an impressive work of scholarship, <i>Agape Agape</i> is foremost an emotional decree, Gaddis's final statement of outrage and sadness at our cultural direction and a plea for change. At less than 100 sparsely punctuated pages, the book is an efficient combustion of energy and an affecting depiction of personal and cultural disintegration. At once a condemnation, warning, and affirmation, it reflects Gaddis's apprehensions but also his enduring faith in the power of creation.

There is a general feeling among people today to know how to be self-sufficient and to care for one&#39;s own general welfare. Established institutions seem to be becoming less and less able to provide the security that many wish to maintain or to acquire. Collecting and using natural herbs is a serious business and should be done with soberness and with good judgment. Many people are poisoned each year in the attempt to use plants for medicinal purposes. Fortunately, not many are fatal. This book is written to aid those interested in collecting and using botanicals for healing purposes. Full color pictures of the plants are included because proper identification is vital where there is a possibility of using the wrong plant. I made a complete review of practically all that has been written on the subject and came to the conclusion that something was lacking. Simply listing a plant and what it was reported to do left most people wondering, where do I find this plant? And once I locate it, what then? Many serious errors were also made in the classification of the plants. Reputed &#39;cures&#39; varied from book to book. Medicinal uses listed in this book were checked with reliable contemporary practitioners and cross-referenced with some of the practitioners of the past. I have used many of the plants included in this book and know the great benefit they offer. Official Pharmacopoeias and Formularies (both American and British) were also used to verify the healing status of the plant....&#34;</p><p></p><h2>�avancemos!: Student Edition Level 1b 2018 (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>Avancemos!: Student Edition Level 1B 2018 (Spanish Edition) by HOUGHTON MIFFLIN HARCOURT (Author) Product details Series: Avancemos!

We love the performance, the big win, the ticking seconds of the clock as the game comes down to the wire. We watch games and cheer, sometimes to the point of obsession, but if we really wanted to see greatness&#x2014;wanted to cheer for it, see it happen, understand what made it happen&#x2014;we'd spend our time watching, obsessing on, and maybe even cheering the practices instead. This book puts practice on the front burner of all who seek to instill talent and achievement in others as well as in themselves. This is a journey to understand that practice, not games, makes champions.</p> <p>In this book, the authors engage the dream of better, both in fields and endeavors where participants know they should practice and also in those where many do not yet recognize the transformative power of practice. And it&#x2019;s not just whether you practice. How you practice may be a true competitive advantage. Deliberately engineered and designed practice can revolutionize our most important endeavors. The clear set of rules presented in <i>Practice Perfect</i> will make us better in virtually every performance of life. The &#x201c;how-to&#x201d; rules of practice cover such topics as rethinking practice, modeling excellent practice, using feedback, creating a culture of practice, making new skills stick, and hiring for practice.</p> <ul> <li>Discover new ways to think about practice. Learn how to design successful practice. Apply practice across a wide range of realms, both personal and professional</li> <li>The authors include specific activities to jump-start practice</li> <li>Doug Lemov is the best-selling author of <i>Teach Like a Champion</i></li> </ul> <p>A hands-on resource to practice, the rules within will help to create positive outliers and world-changing reservoirs of talent.</p></p><p><p><b>Amazon.com Exclusive: Q &amp; A with Authors Doug Lemov, Erica Woolway, and Katie Yezzi </b></p> <p><b>What would you say are the few biggest misconceptions around practice? </b></p> <p>Though we&#x2019;ve found there are actually more than a few misconceptions about practice, here are three: </p><ul> <li>Myth 1: <em>Practice to improve your weaknesses.</em> Not true. You should in fact focus on practicing strengths. You&#x2019;ll get stronger results this way. </li> <li>Myth 2: <em>Stop practicing when you achieve competence.</em> Nope. What marks champions is their excellence at something&#x2014;they may have weaknesses, but their strengths are honed and polished to the level of brilliance. The value of practice begins at mastery! </li> <li>Myth 3: <em>Practice is dull.</em> Wrong. It certainly has a reputation for being a bleak necessity and the primary provenance of children laboring over trombones and basketballs. But in fact, practice is fun, exciting, and ideal for adults. </li> </ul> <p></p> <p><b>How do you suggest people incorporate the right kind of practice into their daily lives? </b></p> <p> There are many ways. One concrete idea is to practice with a partner. Find a peer who cares as much as you do about some key aspect of your work and schedule ten (fun) minutes, three times a week, to work on the skills you&#x2019;re both interested in developing. </p> <p><b>What does each of you practice in your professional or personal lives? </b></p> <p> Doug: I practice a lot with my kids. They&#x2019;re athletes&#x2014;soccer players and skiers, especially. It&#x2019;s my goal to help them be good at something they care about. And though I played soccer in college, I think back with sadness at how much better I wanted to be and how much time I spent trying to get better on my own when, in retrospect, I was wasting my time. I learned how to handle the ball only long after college. And so, in addition to wanting to help my kids succeed at the things they love, I want to model for them how to get better at things throughout their lives, so they never have to feel that. One bright spot, one thing I think was very helpful to them as soccer players, is the two-footed drill. I started having them do it when they were younger to get them natural and fluid at two of the core building blocks of soccer&#x2014;being able to use both feet and being in the habit of redirecting your first touch. In the two-footed drill, we pass the ball back and forth, but you have to receive the ball with one foot, transfer it to the other foot on the first touch, and pass it back with that foot&#x2014;in one fluid motion. Always two feet; always two touches. And the focal point is the speed of the foot-to-foot process. Once my kids got it down, we just kept doing it, over and over. We do it every time we warm up, so they are fluid, natural, and automatic. It&#x2019;s definitely made them much more fundamentally sound at the game. It&#x2019;s also allowed them to allocate their brain power to thinking about what to do with the ball when they get it in the game, since they&#x2019;re pretty automatic at receiving. </p> <p> Erica: In my professional life, what I find myself practicing most are the presentations that I have to give in front of large audiences. In preparing for a presentation, after I have created and revised my materials, I carefully script my talking points. I then practice delivering the presentation quietly to myself; when I am ready, I ask a colleague to watch a small section and give feedback on any part that is new or particularly challenging for me. My final step the morning of the presentation is usually to practice in front of a full-length mirror. The first time I did this (after getting over feeling incredibly awkward) I learned so much about my non-verbal communication. I saw myself shifting my weight frequently from foot to foot, and I realized that signaled a lack of confidence to my audience. Every time I practice with a mirror, I learn something new about what I am signaling to my audience. In my personal life I practice with my kids, but not in the traditional sense of the word. My oldest son is only four, so he is still too young for the consistent practice of a particular sport or hobby, but he and his little brother are not too young to benefit from practice. For example I realized recently that our bedtime routine (from brushing our teeth to heads asleep on pillows) was taking entirely too long. So I planned how to streamline it, explained it to them step-by-step, and we practiced it a few times around 3pm on a Saturday afternoon. That first night, they were excited about the new &#x201c;Bedtime Club,&#x201d; and we followed all the steps to a tee&#x2013;cutting bedtime in half. We then practiced it consistently for a week or so, and now everybody in our house feels a little less stress in the evenings. </p> <p> Katie: I try to practice difficult conversations that I know I need to have with colleagues or the parents of the students in the school I lead. I usually practice with my managing director, and that almost always includes me taking notes as he models what that conversation might sound like. In particular, I write down key phrases in outline format to ensure I remember the key points and make them clearly. I run through what I want to say a couple times in that moment, and I usually do it again as I drive home. Then, I review my notes right before I have the conversation. Practice definitely helps me to stay calm and confident when emotions are high. In my personal life, I play and practice Ultimate Frisbee. I&#x2019;ve played for over 20 years, but what I practice most are the basic skills of throwing and catching. I notice that it makes a huge difference in my pass completion during games if I have practiced completing passes before playing. That kind of practice makes me more focused and more confident. </p><p><b>Praise for <i>Practice Perfect</i></b></p> <p>"There are no shortcuts to success, whether it be in education, sports, or business.

Additionally, the book presents a conceptual framework of ethical pluralism to help readers understand the relationship among various theories. Lawrence Hinman, one of the most respected and accomplished professionals in ethics and philosophy education today, presents a text that gives readers plentiful opportunities to explore ethical theory and their own responses to them, using fascinating features such as the &#34;Ethical Inventory&#34; sections that appear at the beginning and the end of the text. End-of-chapter discussion questions, and the use of current issues and movies help students retain what they&#39;ve learn and truly comprehend the subject matter.</p><p>Ethics is a conversation, and as author of this book on ethical theory I see my role to be that of the good host, introducing you (the reader) to those who are already engaged in the conversation (major figures in ethical theory) and filling in for you the background of what they have said. &nbsp;My hope is that, with such an introduction, you can then participate more fully and knowledgeably in the conversation.I am a Professor of Philosophy at the University of San Diego, where I have been teaching philosophy for several decades.

Andreas shows the best way to cure gravlaks, make butter, prepare a poached salmon feast, and flamb� a pork tenderloin with Scandinavia's favorite spirit aquavit. He shares his passion for traditional recipes such as Pork Rib Roast with Cloves, Mashed Rutabaga, and Norwegian Pancakes filled with berries.<br><br>In <i>Kitchen of Light</i> readers are transported to Viestad's Norway&#x2014;fishing for cod, halibut, and salmon; gathering chanterelles, porcini, and wild berries. More than 100 recipes emphasize fresh, simple ingredients in delicious and elegant dishes such as Pepper-Grilled Oysters and Scallops and Roast Dill-Scented Chicken with Leeks and Potatoes. This inspired cookbook, a companion to the public television series <i>New Scandinavian Cooking</i>, is perfect for home cooks, armchair travelers, cultural food enthusiasts, and anyone who yearns for the simple life.</p></p><p>In Scandinavia, where the land stretches far enough north that half the year can be bathed in constant light or constant darkness, the notion of a "kitchen of light" has special meaning. In the case of <i>Kitchen of Light</i>, the cookbook by Norway's best known food writer, Andreas Viestad, and companion book to the TV cooking show of the same name, it means the shedding of light on a long-overlooked cuisine and culinary tradition. There is more going on in the Land of the Midnight Sun than smorgasbord.<p> Fresh, local, and seasonal ingredients need not always be a notion married to temperate agriculture and culinary zones. The seasons of fecundity can be compressed; the nature of local can truly be wild. Such are the lessons in <i>Kitchen of Light</i>. There is an underlying joy throughout this book: the long winter has been beaten back and great food once again weighs down the table. Viestad takes the reader into the country and into the lives of the people who have made something of a celebration of food and cooking.</p><p> Duck Soup with Madeira ought to wake up the sleepiest palate. In centuries past, Maderia was bartered in Norway for dried salt cod. Porcini Consomm� gives honor to the brief but glorious wild mushroom season. An entire chapter is given over to gravlaks, cured salmon you can do at home with spice and Aquavit. In a land where cod and potatoes are no joke, Viestad proves that a contemporary touch can be both relevant and exciting. Yellow and Red Cod with Pomegranate-Mango Salad, anyone? Feasting is well-represented, and seafood lies at its heart--salmon, halibut, mackerel, pollock, shellfish. And just when you are falling into step, Viestad turn the corner and presents the likes of Glazed Leg of Lamb with Roasted Root Vegetables.</p><p> In the end, after reading and admiring this beautifully photographed and designed book where travel meets food meets joy, you'll have a much better insight into the people of Scandinavia, and probably a deep and unresolved desire to travel and dine there. <i>Kitchen of Light</i> is not only enlightening, you can bring it home. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p><p>Andreas Viestad is Norway&#x2019;s premier food columnist and writes a weekly column in <i>Dagbladet</i>.

One day, inexplicably and without warning, Sarah had broken off the relationship. It seemed impossible that there could be a rival for her heart. Yet two years later, driven by obsessive jealousy and grief, Bendrix sends Pakris, a private detective, to follow Sarah and find out the truth.</p><p>Set in London during and just after World War II, Graham Greene's <i>The End of the Affair</i> is a pathos-laden examination of a three-way collision between love of self, love of another, and love of God. The affair in question involves Maurice Bendrix, a solipsistic novelist, and a dutifully married woman, Sarah Miles. The lovers meet at a party thrown by Sarah's dreary civil-servant husband, and proceed to liberate each other from boredom and routine unhappiness. Reflecting on the ebullient beginnings of their romance, Bendrix recalls: "There was never any question in those days of who wanted whom--we were together in desire." Indeed, the affair goes on unchecked for several years until, during an afternoon tryst, Bendrix goes downstairs to look for intruders in his basement and a bomb falls on the building. Sarah rushes down to find him lying under a fallen door, and immediately makes a deal with God, whom she has never particularly cared for. "I love him and I'll do anything if you'll make him alive.... I'll give him up forever, only let him be alive with a chance.... People can love each other without seeing each other, can't they, they love You all their lives without seeing You." <p> Bendrix, as evidenced by his ability to tell the story, is not dead, merely unconscious, and so Sarah must keep her promise. She breaks off the relationship without giving a reason, leaving Bendrix mystified and angry. The only explanation he can think of is that she's left him for another man. It isn't until years later, when he hires a private detective to ascertain the truth, that he learns of her impassioned vow. Sarah herself comes to understand her move through a strange rationalization. Writing to God in her journal, she says: </p><blockquote> You willed our separation, but he [Bendrix] willed it too. He worked for it with his anger and his jealousy, and he worked for it with his love. For he gave me so much love, and I gave him so much love that soon there wasn't anything left, when we'd finished, but You. </blockquote> It's as though the pull toward faith were inevitable, if incomprehensible--perhaps as punishment for her sin of adultery. In her final years, Sarah's faith only deepens, even as she remains haunted by the bombing and the power of her own attraction to God. Set against the backdrop of a war-ravaged city, <i>The End of the Affair</i> is equally haunting as it lays forth the question of what constitutes love in troubling, unequivocal terms. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i>The love affair between Maurice Bendix and Sarah, flourishing in the turbulent times of the London Blitz, ends when she suddenly breaks it off. A chance meeting rekindles his love and jealousy two years later, and Bendix hires a private detective to follow Sarah. Slowly his love for her turns into an obsession. <br> <br> <br> <i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Adversity Quotient: Turning Obstacles into Opportunities</h2><p>Praise for Adversity Quotient.<br> <br> "With AQ, Paul Stoltz has done something remarkable: He synthesizes some of the most important information on how we influence our own future and then offers a profound set of observations which teaches us how to thrive in a fast-changing world!"-Joel Barker, President, Infinity, LTD, author of Paradigm Shift.<br> <br> "Adversity Quotient will show that you have more control over events than you think. The key is changing your beliefs. Believe it or not, that can usually be done in One Minute." -Ken Blanchard, co-author, The One Minute Manager.<br> <br> "Paul Stoltz's AQ explains why some people, teams, organizations, and societies fail or quit, and how others in the situation persevere and succeed. With this book, anyone or or organization can learn to reroute their AQ and hardwire their brain for success." -Daniel Burrus, author, Technotrends.<br> <br> "AQ is one of the more important concepts of our time. Paul Stoltz's book provides the direction and tools necessary for putting this idea into practice. It is a must read for anyone interested in personal mastery, leadership effectiveness and/or organizational productivity." -Jim Ericson, Program Director, The Masters Forum.</p><p>First there was IQ, then there was EQ. Now, there's yet another quotient to worry about--AQ. Designed especially for business owners of quickly growing companies, <i>Adversity Quotient</i> draws upon the sciences of psychoneuroimmunology, neurophysiology, and cognitive psychology. As scientifically based as it is, the book manages to be compellingly readable. <p> Author Paul G. Stoltz, Ph.D., says individual AQs explain why some people, no matter what their intelligence or educational or social background, succeed where others fail. It's been used in workshops for Olympic athletes and at companies including Deloitte &amp; Touche, Minnesota Power, and U.S. West. Defined as the measure of one's resilience and ability to persevere in the face of constant change, stress, and difficulty, AQ is touted as "the most important factor in achieving success." Stoltz also calls it an indicator of one's general ambitiousness, creativity, happiness, energy, and physical and emotional health; he therefore recommends that business executives use the book's guidelines to pinpoint top performers in the workplace. </p><p> While the book is filled with acronyms and buzzwords (LEAD, "unconscious incompetence," ARP, and CO2RE among them), the book's tests--reminiscent of Myers-Briggs questionnaires--are fun to take and easy to analyze. Stoltz has given the tests to nearly 8,000 people, so he obviously knows what he's talking about here. He offers specific advice on how to cultivate AQ in employees, and, perhaps even more useful, 22 ways to crush the AQs of your followers. (One of them, "Be consistently inconsistent," could explain many "Dilbert" strips!) </p><p> While Stoltz derives many of his ideas from psychologist Abraham Maslow, psychologist and <i>Learned Optimism</i> author Martin Seligman, and <i>7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i> writer Stephen R. Covey, he gives credit where it's due, and he's done an outstanding job of synthesizing various classic and contemporary theories into one solidly inspirational book.</p>Based on recent scientific breakthroughs in immunology, physiology and psychology and backed by the finding of over 7,500 people who have attended the author&#39;s one-day workshop, AQ (Adversity Quotient) is the most global predictor of success. AQ predicts and in many cases determines your ability to learn, be productive, competitive and resistant as well as respond to change. The book, through the adversity response profile, measures your AQ then provides a scientifically proven sequence for permanently boosting AQ. Numerous exercises and activities are provided for improving the way you handle adversity.</p><h2>Environmental Ethics: Divergence and Convergence</h2><p>Will be shipped from US.

The novel depicts the experiences of Fuselli, a store clerk from San Francisco pathetically eager to win promotion; Chrisfield, an Indiana farmer who comes to hate army discipline; and Andrews, an introspective aspiring composer from New York, as they fight in the final battles of the war and then confront a world in which an illusory peace offers little respite from the dehumanizing servility and regimentation of militarized life.<br><br>Dos Passos described&nbsp;<i>Manhattan Transfer</i>&nbsp;(1925), a kaleidoscopic portrait of New York City in the first two decades of the 20th century, as &#x201c;utterly fantastic and New Yorkish.&#x201d; Drawing on the naturalism of Theodore Dreiser and the modernism of James Joyce, the novel follows the rising and falling fortunes of more than a dozen characters as they move through a bewildering maze of tenements and skyscrapers in which Wall Street speculators, theatrical celebrities, impoverished immigrants, and anarchist rebels all strive to make sense out of the chaos of modern urban existence.<b><br><br>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

If you haven't read it recently, though, you may not remember the sweeping force of the prose, the grotesque, surreal imagery, and the multilayered <i>doppelg�nger</i> themes of Mary Shelley's masterpiece. As fantasy writer Jane Yolen writes of this (the reviewer's favorite) edition, "The strong black and whites of the main text [illustrations] are dark and brooding, with unremitting shadows and stark contrasts. But the central conversation with the monster--who owes nothing to the overused movie image ... but is rather the novel's charnel-house composite--is where [Barry] Moser's illustrations show their greatest power ... The viewer can all but smell the powerful stench of the monster's breath as its words spill out across the page. Strong book-making for one of the world's strongest and most remarkable books."

Feynman's contributions to twentieth-century physics, but few realize how engaged he was with the world around him&#x2014;how deeply and thoughtfully he considered the religious, political, and social issues of his day. Now, a wonderful book&#x2014;based on a previously unpublished, three-part public lecture he gave at the University of Washington in 1963&#x2014;shows us this other side of Feynman, as he expounds on the inherent conflict between science and religion, people's distrust of politicians, and our universal fascination with flying saucers, faith healing, and mental telepathy. Here we see Feynman in top form: nearly bursting into a Navajo war chant, then pressing for an overhaul of the English language (if you want to know why Johnny can't read, just look at the spelling of &#x201c;friend&#x201d;); and, finally, ruminating on the death of his first wife from tuberculosis. This is quintessential Feynman&#x2014;reflective, amusing, and ever enlightening.</p><p>In this series of lectures originally given in 1963, which remained unpublished during Richard Feynman's lifetime, the Nobel-winning physicist thinks aloud on several "meta"--questions of science. What is the nature of the tension between science and religious faith? Why does uncertainty play such a crucial role in the scientific imagination? Is this <i>really</i> a scientific age?<p> Marked by Feynman's characteristic combination of rationality and humor, these lectures provide an intimate glimpse at the man behind the legend. "In case you are beginning to believe," he says at the start of his final lecture, "that some of the things I said before are true because I am a scientist and according to the brochure that you get I won some awards and so forth, instead of your looking at the ideas themselves and judging them directly...I will get rid of that tonight. I dedicate this lecture to showing what ridiculous conclusions and rare statements such a man as myself can make." Rare, perhaps. Irreverent, sure. But ridiculous? Not even close.</p><b>How I Found <i>The Meaning of It All</i></b> <p> One day in June of 1997, I was combing through the Feynman archives in the basement of CalTech. My goal was to see what unpublished gems might lie in the midst of the paper relics stored there since, several years earlier, Addison Wesley Longman's General Publishing Group had signed an agreement with Richard P. Feynman's heirs for the exclusive right to publish material from his Nachlass.</p><p> After days of poring through Feynman's handwritten equations, letters, postcards, lecture notes, and other miscellany, I came across a manuscript transcribed from three public lectures (part of the University of Washington's John Danz Memorial Lecture Series), entitled "A Scientist Looks at Society," that Feynman gave in April of 1963. For although Feynman had not yet won the greatest scientific accolade of our time, the Nobel Prize, nor had yet published his bestselling autobiography, <i>Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!</i>, he was already widely known for his remarkable insight into the laws of nature, for his extraordinary teaching ability, and for his famous three-volume textbook, <i>The Feynman Lectures on Physics</i>. By 1963, Feynman was a much sought after public speaker. </p><p> My initial delight after reading these lectures was overshadowed by the nagging fear that they had already been published somewhere. Here was Feynman on science, on society, on religion, on peace and war, on all the concerns of the modern citizen-scientist--surely someone had published this intimate look at the personal thoughts of this most respected figure! And indeed, the same folder disclosed the information that, like the previous Danz Lectures delivered by such luminaries as Fred Hoyle, the resulting manuscript would be published by the University of Washington Press in book form. </p><p> Curiously, though, the Feynman bibliography did not list any such publication, nor did Books in Print; nor did Feynman's heirs have any record of the book having been published. Finally, I reached the Press's editor, Emily Pascal (who ironically had been the series editor in 1963 when Feynman had originally given the lectures), who confirmed that the book had never been published. Not only had Feynman not signed the agreement, but he lost interest in the project after editing only the first lecture! Typical Feynman: after completing a project or lecture, he often lost interest in it; his fertile but impatient mind was already off and running after the next "in-te-rest-ing" problem. But what an exciting discovery for Feynman fans, 35 years later! </p><p> I quickly consulted with Feynman's heirs, and we signed the publishing agreement for these wonderful, prophetic, and insightful lectures, renamed <i>The Meaning of It All: Thoughts of a Citizen Scientist</i>. I hope everyone enjoys them as much as I have.</p></p><h2>Personality: Classic Theories and Modern Research (5th Edition)</h2><p><p> <b>This successful text puts &#x201c;personality&#x201d; back into the personality course, integrating the classic insights of the personality theorists with modern research in a manner that will fascinate and encourage deeper thought.</b> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This text explores classic theory from a perspective that encourages critical thinking and fosters intellectual insight with respect to human nature.&nbsp; For example, it shows the relevance of classic theory to topics of personality and culture, evolution, ego, gender, and person-situation interactionism.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Employing the highest scientific standards, <i>Personality </i>also uses a wide range of unique and provocative pedagogical devices that have been shown to motivate students.&nbsp;Hailed as the best-written, most relevant personality textbook on the market,&nbsp;Friedman and Schustack's fourth edition brings the field of personality to today's diverse student body.</p></p><p><p> <b>Howard S.

As a religious novel about a decaying brahmin colony in the south Indian village of Karnataka, <em>Samskara</em> serves as an allegory rich in realistic detail, a contemporary reworking of ancient Hindu themes and myths, and a serious, poetic study of a religious man living in a community of priests gone to seed. A death which stands as the central event in the plot brings in its wake a plague, many more deaths, live questions with only dead answers, moral chaos, and the rebirth of one man.

Praised for its coverage of theoretical inorganic chemistry, it discusses molecular symmetry earlier than other texts and builds on this foundation in later chapters. Plenty of supporting book references encourage you to further explore topics of interest.</p></p><p>This introduction to inorganic chemistry emphasizes the use of bonding theories to explain the structures and reactions of inorganic compounds.Preface <p> A new edition of a text can mean many things. To authors, it is a chance to try again to get it right and readable, and to revise outdated sections. To teachers and students, the new edition is potentially a more readable and useful text. For the author's family and friends, it is a chance to reclaim the attention that was devoted to the revising process. And finally, it means that the first edition was successful enough that a revision is necessary. We hope potential users will agree that this second edition retains the best features of the first edition and corrects any flaws. </p><p> As in the first edition of Inorganic Chemistry, we have chosen to emphasize molecular orbitals and symmetry in many aspects of bonding and reactivity. For example, we have devoted an early chapter, Chapter 4, to a discussion of molecular symmetry and introductory group theory, with examples of applications to molecular vibrations and chirality. In later chapters, we have used group theory in a variety of other applications, including molecular orbitals of main group compounds (Chapter 5) and coordination complexes (Chapter 10), and infrared spectra of organometallic compounds (Chapter 13). Additional applications of group theory are included in problems at the end of these and other chapters. </p><p> The early chapters provide a review of atomic theory (Chapter 2) and simple concepts of chemical bonding (Chapter 3). Following the introduction to group theory in Chapter 4, this theory is applied to the construction of molecular orbitals in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 provides a discussion of various acid-base concepts, emphasizing applications of molecular orbitals to acid-base interactions. Following the advice of many, we have added a chapter on solid state inorganic chemistry (Chapter 7). Chapter 8 summarizes some of the most important aspects of main group elements and their compounds. The rapid development of chemistry of the fullerenes has been recognized in a discussion of these molecules in Chapter 8 and of fullerene complexes in Chapter 13. </p><p> Chapters 9 through 14 are directed to the chemistry of the transition elements. The first four of these chapters deal, respectively, with the structures, bonding, electronic spectra, and reactions of classical transition metal complexes. We have followed reviewers' advice in reorganizing these chapters into this sequence. For this edition we have moved the discussion of terms and microstates into Chapter 11 so it immediately precedes its most common use, interpretation of spectra of coordination complexes. We have written the section on terms and microstates so it can still be used with the discussion of atomic spectra (Chapter 2) for those who might wish to follow the organization of the first edition. </p><p> Chapters 13 and 14 provide an introduction to organometallic compounds, their spectra, and reactions. Special attention has been given to catalytic cycles and their application to problems of chemical and industrial significance. </p><p> We believe that seeking similarities in the chemistry of different types of compounds can be an extremely valuable exercise, and we have therefore discussed some of these important parallels in Chapter 15, placing particular emphasis on the isolobal analogy developed by Roald Hoffmann and on similarities between main group and transition metal clusters. </p><p> Finally, no text would be complete without a discussion of the role of inorganic compounds in biological processes and in the environment. We have therefore devoted the final chapter, Chapter 16, to selected aspects of bioinorganic and environmental inorganic chemistry. </p><p> We have chosen the topics and the level of treatment that works well for us. Every teacher has favorite topics, as well as least-favorite ones. We hope that our choice of topics allows potential users to tailor the contents to their own courses. We welcome suggestions for improvements in future editions. </p><p> In addition to selecting the most appropriate topics, we have attempted to make our text as accessible to students as possible. We have therefore increased the number of examples and exercises within the chapters, with answers to examples included in the chapters and answers to exercises in Appendix A. To encourage use of the literature in inorganic chemistry, we have retained the extensive references in the first edition and have also increased the number of end-of-chapter problems taken from the chemical literature. We hope that these will be useful to both faculty and students using this text. At the end of each chapter is a list of suggested supplemental readings, with brief comments on each. </p><p> We want to express special appreciation to our students, who have submitted many suggestions for improving the clarity and accuracy of this edition. We especially appreciate one student, Beth Truesdale (now a Rhodes Scholar), who reviewed every chapter in detail and made hundreds of valuable suggestions. Thanks also to those from other schools who reviewed this book in preparation and offered many helpful suggestions: </p><p> Christopher W. Allen, University of Vermont<br> E.

Using Titus 2 as a guide, seasoned author Susan Hunt casts a biblical vision of what the church can be when women invest in vibrant relationships with one another. Featuring inspiring stories from the Bible and from women today who have faithfully embraced Scripture&#x2019;s command, this book offers readers an abundance of practical insights, ministry-tested how-to&#x2019;s, and personal encouragement. Now featuring a new cover, this classic book will inspire a new generation of women to seek out the blessing of godly relationships that will encourage and equip them to live for God&#x2019;s glory.</p></p><p><p><strong>Susan Hunt</strong> is a mother, grandmother, pastor&#x2019;s wife, author, and the former director of women&#x2019;s ministries for the Presbyterian Church in America. Hunt has written a number of books, including <em>Spiritual Mothering</em>.</p><p>Former Director of Women's Ministries, PCA; coauthor, <em>Women's Ministry in the Local Church</em></p><p>&#x201c;I read this book about twenty years ago as a new Christian. Longing for a spiritual mother, I found Susan Hunt discipling me from these pages and stirring my heart to pour out to others what she had poured into me. I followed her example set forth in this book as I began to understand the importance of discipleship in the Christian life. Grounded in Scripture, wed to the local church, specific to women, personal, wise, hopeful, and engaging&#x2015;this book will be both a ready reference for your discipleship of women and an encouragement to both young and old as you strive to live for God&#x2019;s glory.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Kristie Anyabwile,</strong> wife of Thabiti Anyabwile, Pastor, Anacostia River Church, Washington, DC; mom of three; discipler of women</p><p>&#x201c;I do not know of anyone better qualified to write a book on spiritual mothering than Susan Hunt. This is a subject she has been passionate about and has modeled for many years. Susan has been an older woman in my life, and her example has encouraged me to embrace the calling of pouring my life into women of the next generation. No message could be more relevant, more needed, more rewarding, or more Christ-honoring for Christian women of all ages.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Nancy DeMoss Wolgemuth,</strong> author, <em>Adorned</em>; Teacher and Host, <em>Revive Our Hearts</em></p><p>&#x201c;In my thirty years of ministry, one of the most heartbreaking and eye-opening revelations I&#x2019;ve had is that so many women have never experienced intentional discipleship through their local churches. I was poured into very consistently for four years when I was a university student through a campus organization, which laid the foundation for my spiritual life and ministry. How I would have loved for older women in the church to disciple me with that same intentionality and passion! <em>Spiritual Mothering</em> enters into the void with hope, practical teaching, and rich biblical encouragement for women of all ages to be nurtured in life-on-life relationships for the sake of the gospel. I am excited for Susan Hunt&#x2019;s updated resource, which is filled with the timeless truth of God&#x2019;s Word.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Ellen Mary Dykas,</strong> Women&#x2019;s Ministry Coordinator, Harvest USA; editor, <em>Sexual Sanity for Women</em></p><p>&#x201c;Susan Hunt is committed to declare the glorious deeds of the Lord to the next generation so they will set their hope in God (Ps. 78:1&#x2013;7). This commitment shines through the pages of <em>Spiritual Mothering</em> as Susan helps another generation fulfill this gospel mandate. This book is a gift to the church, filled with tender wisdom that flows from a life in fellowship with God and others. <em>Spiritual Mothering</em> will encourage and challenge you to grow in your relationship with the Lord so that you give yourself to the next generation.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Stephen T. Estock,</strong> Coordinator, PCA Discipleship Ministries</p><p>&#x201c;I praise God for the wisdom of Susan Hunt. Through this book, she spiritually mothered me and many of my seminary friends from afar. In these days when the world tells women to follow their hearts, here we have a clarion call to follow Jesus. I&#x2019;m excited to see this book get into the hands of more young women who need to be encouraged in their calling to make disciples of the nations.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Gloria Furman,</strong> author, <em>Missional Motherhood</em> and <em>Treasuring Christ When Your Hands Are Full</em></p><p>&#x201c;Twenty-five years later, these truths are more than mere words to me, for I have seen their shape worked out in my own life and the lives of countless women. One of my greatest joys has been witnessing the cultivation of a culture that encourages gospel friendships between older and younger woman to flourish. These truths have yielded not just healthy women, but more importantly, healthy churches.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Karen Hodge,</strong> Coordinator of Women&#x2019;s Ministries, Presbyterian Church in America; coauthor, <em>Life-giving Leadership</em> and <em>Transformed</em></p><p>&#x201c;I first read <em>Spiritual Mothering</em> almost twenty years ago. After years of ministry, I am more convinced that this book should be read by every woman seeking to invest in other women. Susan Hunt wisely unpacks Titus 2 with theological precision, practical application, and faithful encouragement. I recommend this book in the hope that Susan&#x2019;s words will spur us on to share Jesus&#x2015;woman to woman, generation to generation, so that the entire church will be built up and strengthened, all to the glory of God.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Melissa B. Kruger,</strong> Director of Women&#x2019;s Content, The Gospel Coalition; author, <em>In All Things</em> and <em>Growing Together</em></p><p>&#x201c;You can tell by her smile and her countenance that Susan Hunt is the kind of older woman any wise younger woman would want to have as a mentor.

A wife can only surrender to a desert night by betraying her husband. An artist struggles to honor his own aspirations as well as society's expectations of him. A missionary brutally converted to the worship of a tribal fetish is left with but an echo of his identity. Whether set in North Africa, Paris, or Brazil, the stories in <i>Exile and the Kingdom</i> are probing portraits of spiritual exile, and man&#x2019;s perpetual search for an inner kingdom in which to be reborn. They display Camus at the height of his powers. <br> <br>Now, on the 50th anniversary of the book&#x2019;s publication, Carol Cosman&#x2019;s new translation recovers a literary treasure for our time. <br><br>Albert Camus won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957.</p><p>These six stories, written at the height of Camus&#39; artistic powers, all depict people at decisive, revelatory moments in their lives. Translated by Justin O&#39;Brien.Albert Camus was born in Algeria in 1913. He spent the early years of his life in North Africa, where he worked at various jobs&#x2014;in a weather bureau, in an automobile supply firm, in a shipping company&#x2014;to help pay for his courses at the University of Algiers. He went on to become a journalist, and from 1935 to 1938 he ran the Theatre de l'Equipe, a theatrical company that produced plays by Malraux, Gide, Synge, Dostoyevsky, and others. During World War II he was one of the leading writers of the French Resistance and editor of Combat, then an important underground newspaper. His fiction, including <i>The Stranger</i>, <i>The Plague</i>, <i>The Fall</i>, and <i>Exile and the Kingdom</i>; his philosophical essays, "The Myth of Sisyphus" and "The Rebel"; and his plays have assured his preeminent position in modern letters. In 1957 Camus was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. On January 4, 1960, he was killed in a car accident. Carol Cosman has translated works by Balzac and Simone de Beauvoir from the French as well as JeanPaul Sartre's biography of Flaubert.</p><h2>Project to Product: How to Survive and Thrive in the Age of Digital Disruption with the Flow Framework</h2><p>In the Age of Software, will your business dominate and maintain relevance&#x2015;or will it become a digital relic?<br>As tech giants and startups disrupt every market, those who master large-scale software delivery will define the economic landscape of the 21st century, just as the masters of mass production defined the landscape in the 20th. Unfortunately, business and technology leaders are woefully ill-equipped to solve the problems posed by digital transformation. At the current rate of disruption, half of S&amp;P 500 companies will be replaced in the next ten years. A new approach is needed. <br>In <i>Project to Product</i>, Value Stream Network pioneer and technology business leader Dr. Mik Kersten introduces the Flow Framework&#x2015;a new way of seeing, measuring, and managing software delivery. The Flow Framework will enable your company's evolution from project-oriented dinosaur to product-centric innovator that thrives in the Age of Software. If you're driving your organization's transformation at any level, this is the book for you.</p><p><p>Dr. Mik Kersten started his career as a Research Scientist at Xerox PARC where he created the first aspect-oriented development environment. He then pioneered the integration of development tools with Agile and DevOps as part of his Computer Science PhD at the University of British Columbia. Founding Tasktop out of that research, Mik has written over one million lines of open-source code that is still in use today, and he has brought seven successful open-source and commercial products to market. </p><br><p>Mik's experiences working with some of the largest digital transformations in the world has led him to identify the critical disconnect between business leaders and technologists. Since that time, Mik has been working on creating new tools and a new framework for connecting software value stream networks and enabling the shift from project to product. </p><br><p>Mik lives with his family in Vancouver, Canada, and travels globally, sharing his vision for transforming how software is built. </p>"If you want to get rid of obsolete practices and succeed with the new digital, read this book." (Carlota Perez, author of Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital: The Dynamics of Bubbles and Golden Ages)<br><br>"Project to Product is going to be one of the most influential reads of 2019 and beyond. One that connects work outcomes to business results. One that provides models to make better business decisions. One that gives technology leaders a framework to enable the change necessary for companies to remain relevant.." (Dominica DeGrandis, author of Making Work Visible: Exposing Time Theft to Optimize Work &amp; Flow)<br><br>"Every now and then, a body of work comes along with such timely precision that you think hallelujah! Mik's book Project to Product is the perfect antidote for those businesses struggling with digital transformation, broken Agile implementations, and the onslaught of enterprise disruption. In fact, it's a really important component in the world of flow which is at the forefront of business agility. Not only will this framework help your teams ignite their software delivery cadence but to do it at scale, with high quality, reduced costs, and increased value. And more importantly, with happy teams&#x2015;with the metrics to prove it." (Fin Goulding, International CIO at Aviva and co-author of Flow: A Handbook for Change-Makers, Mavericks, Innovation Activists, Leaders: Digital Transformation Simplified and 12 Steps to Flow: The New Framework for Business Agility)<br><br>"I had the pleasure of having an advance copy of Project to Product at my company over the summer&#x2015;and what an eye opener it is. This book is spot on the journey Volvo Car Group is starting up right now. The insight Mik has in our industry and the way his book describes the Age of Software makes this our new &#x201c;go to&#x201d; book for our product journey in our digital landscape!" (Niclas Ericsson, Senior IT Manager, Volvo Car Corp)<br><br>"With the introduction of the Flow Framework, Mik has provided a missing element to any large-scale Agile transformation. I recommend that anyone involved in complex product delivery read this book and think about how they can apply this thinking to their value stream." (Dave West, CEO Scrum.org and author of Nexus Framework for Scaling Scrum: Continuously Delivering an Integrated Product with Multiple Scrum Teams)<br><br>"Many large organizations are still applying a management model from the early 1900s optimized for manual labor to everything they do, including complex, unique product development. With this book, Mik provides a great articulation of the importance of focussing on the work not the workers, on the value stream network, and on lessons learned on what to avoid. Mik, who has many years experience working with hundreds of companies on this topic, shares his wisdom and insights via a Flow Framework, which is immensely valuable for organizations who recognize the need to move to better ways of working." (Jonathan Smart, Head of Ways of Working, Barclays)<br><br>"Project to Product is a very insightful book, and the overall model Mik lays out for the Flow Framework is especially intriguing. Not only does Mik address the complexities of Agile transformation and moving to a product-based development, he also discusses how to get your architecture, process, and metrics integrated in a way to effectively measure value delivery. I got pretty excited about the Flow Framework and look forward to applying it to my own technology transformation activities." (Ross Clanton, Executive Director, Technology Modernization, Verizon)<br><br>&#x201c;During our transformation to a '100% Agile' BMW Group IT organization, we discovered early on that the former project portfolio approach did not sufficiently support our journey. Therefore, we started with a transition from 'project to product.' The exchanges with Mik on the topic of product orientation and the Flow Framework was very helpful and a real inspiration for me. The fact that Mik is now sharing his vast knowledge in this book makes me particularly happy. It provides the motivation and the toolset necessary to help create a product portfolio based on a value driven approach. For me it is a must read&#x2015;and indeed it is also a fun read.&#x201d; (Ralf Waltram, Head of IT Systems Research &amp; Development, BMW Group)<br><br>&#x201c;Organizing software development as a group of loosely connected projects will never lead to good products. Kersten explains how to tie work products to value streams corresponding to features, defects, security, and (technical) debt....A major contribution to the theory of management in the age of software.&#x201d; (Carliss Y.

Yet most of us are neither healthy nor happy. We have been led to believe that if we think ahead and make the right choices, we can manifest our dreams.

Yet most of us are neither healthy nor happy. We've become so driven by our ideas about life, that we have actually forgotten how to live. Our stress levels have risen, resulting in more disease and discontent than ever before. Is it possible that our way of life is actually preventing us from experiencing the things we cherish most?</p><p>Nowadays, we are told that the key to living a successful life is to 'be present'. This is considered one of the most important goals for attaining optimal health, peak performance and lasting happiness. Type this into Google, and you are met with headlines like "How to Be Present" or "5 Steps for Being Present." If you watched the women's eight rowing finals at the Rio Olympics, you heard the commentator say, "The women need to be present every stroke &#x2015; their rhythm is in the moment &#x2015; they're living in the moment &#x2015; being the best they can be." So many people yearn to be present that entire retreats revolve around that concept. </p><p>There are millions of websites, books and motivational talks encouraging us to <i>stay in the now. </i>We're told to <i>let go</i> of our limiting beliefs, show up for each moment, and "create" the life we've always wanted. </p><p>We've heard it again and again. We've bought into it. We believe in being present. And yet, it continually eludes us because of a great misconception. </p><p>When our thoughts wander or we catch ourselves worrying, we attempt to refocus on the <i>now</i>, as if we lack the ability to be present without effort. Why does trying to be present feel like we're chasing our shadow&#x2015;no matter how hard we try, it always outruns us? The truth is, we can't <i>create</i> presence, but we can<i> receive </i>it. Presence is not something we have to strive to attain; it is merely the result of merging with what life brings us in each moment, because receiving <i>presence is how the intelligence of life guides all living beings</i>. </p><p>Many self-help titles are based on the idea of "making things happen" or "manifesting." Based on these tomes, most people are under the impression that they have to work at finding and creating the life they want. In my experience, the idea that we have to search for something in life is a fallacy, and when we <i>see</i> this truth, everything changes for us. The struggle is over because we finally realize that something is always searching for us, guiding us toward our life's work and highest calling. It is called <i>light</i>. This is not the light we experience as brightness, but the <i>invisible</i> light of consciousness the Bible refers to as God and quantum physicists equate with the ground of reality. It's the<i> intelligence of life</i>. </p><p><b>More to Vision than Meets the Eye</b></p><p>Forty years ago, while practicing as an optometrist, I experienced a sudden and very significant improvement in eyesight, with no measurable change in my eyeglass prescription. The effect of that miraculous event, which has now persisted for forty years, led me to the realization that while we look with our eyes, we do not 'see' with them. This spurred me on a mission to discover the source of our true seeing: the connection between light, vision and consciousness and, most importantly, who am I, and who is truly the seer? </p><p>These questions drew me to study quantum physics and neuroscience, which inspired me to deeply explore the state of mind that led to my profound vision improvement. So I began a real-time experiment on the workings of my mind. My hope was to uncover a <i>portal</i> into the state of consciousness where profound healing occurs, which in turn would allow me to teach others how to replicate my experience. What I discovered over the years transformed my life, and revealed some fundamental truths about light and vision. These insights allowed me to assist thousands of patients in restoring their natural eyesight without the use of glasses, forming the basis of my first two books: <i>Light: Medicine of the Future </i>and <i>Take Off Your Glasses and See</i>. </p><p>What followed, over the next twenty-five years, was a profound exploration into life, consciousness, and that elusive state we call <i>presence</i>. My discoveries, presented herein, helped me unravel how light continually guides our life. In addition, those breakthroughs were foundational to my development of the first patented, clinically proven, and FDA-cleared medical device that significantly improved vision performance in 2006 and contributed to my induction as President of the International Society for the Study of Subtle Energies and Energy Medicine (ISSSEEM) in 2010. </p><p>To better understand my findings, let's start with light and a broader understanding of it. Light is more than waves and particles. It is a purveyor of consciousness. Light is not just "out there," something we need to find in order to see, but <i>light seeks us out </i>and guides usin the same way it seeks out and directs a plant to grow toward it<i>. </i>There is something inherently alive in it. And, astonishing as it might seem, light not only enters us through our eyes and skin; we literally have light <i>emanating from within us</i>. Consider how babies perceive the world around them. Light ignites their awareness&#x2015;unobstructed by thought, belief, or worry&#x2015;and it radiates back into the world as an expression of pure <i>presence</i>. That's why their eyes sparkle. As we grow from babies, who exist in this unfettered state to adults who are taught to look for life, look for love, look for work, we overlook the fact that our eyes and our minds are not designed to look for light, but to respond to light<i>.</i></p><p>Pioneering experiments have confirmed that the eyes, which contain approximately one billion working parts, not only detect single photons of light before they take shape in form, but also assimilate and distribute that information to our brains at unimaginable speeds. What's more, this entire process occurs before the conscious mind thinks about it and directs us toward what to look at. In addition, cryptochrome, the chemical "sixth sense," which orients animals with the earth's electromagnetic field, has recently been found at highly concentrated levels in our eyes, calibrating us with the unseen "clock and compass" that guides group migrations of many species and even their reproductive cycles. </p><p><b>Looking for Presence </b></p><p>Despite popular belief, attaining <i>presence</i> isn't about thinking or trying to <i>be here now</i>. Rather, it is a naturally occurring state that arises when our eyes and mind, triggered by light, focus on the same place at the same time. In response to light's invitation and guidance, our eyes begin an intricate dance of <i>aiming, focusing, tracking and teaming</i>. When light first "awakens" us, our eyes <i>aim </i>toward its emanation, initiating an all-encompassing <i>presence</i>. Though we often relate <i>presence</i> to attention, it has no tension associated with it&#x2015;a forced voluntary process of selecting one aspect of our environment to focus on while ignoring others. <i>Presence</i> is an involuntary response to an invitation by life's intelligence pointing us toward our maximum potential. </p><p>Our degree of <i>presence</i> is directly related to how effortlessly and accurately our eyes are able to aim. When the eyes aim effectively, making eye contact with&#x2015;and thus, acknowledging&#x2015;what has called to them, we experience <i>congruence</i>. This is a state of coming together, the perfect alignment of our outer and inner worlds, where extraneous noise around us diminishes. </p><p>I discovered this during my career as an optometrist and vision scientist. When patients came to me with vision problems, I found that most of the time their eyes would look at one spot, but their mind would be elsewhere. There was a lack of congruence between what their eyes and their mind were seeing, interfering with their natural ability to experience presence. In one of my research studies, published in 1976, I found that nearly 70 percent of the participants were not looking where they thought they were looking, a sign that their eyes and mind were not converged on the same point. In addition, more than half of the subjects were looking too hard, revealing a tendency to push rather than allow things to unfold before their eyes. I also observed that the more my patients worked at seeing or understanding something, the more they held their breath and the less they actually saw. However, when their natural breathing cycle was restored, they relaxed, and their vision and learning ability significantly improved.</p><p>This is why presence is so rare. When our physical eyes (which receive 80-90% of our life experience) are not aligned with our "mind's eye," it is impossible to experience presence or oneness. If you are middle-aged or older and have taken to using reading glasses, then you already know what it feels like when you are at the pharmacy without your reading glasses, and are trying to read the small print on the label of a supplement container. The harder you try, the more your eyes strain. Yet, the text on the container still doesn't come into focus. The way to see the text more clearly lies in releasing your effort and softening your focus, allowing your mind and your eyes to naturally align themselves. You can't force this, but you can learn how to allow it naturally with a simple one-minute vision exercise that I reveal later in this book<i>.</i> </p><p>Using just a string and a few beads, you can <i>see </i>my point and directly experience your eyes and mind aligning&#x2015;not by forcing the process, but by allowing it. Since such <i>awareness is curative, </i>once you've experienced it, you won't go back to your old way of seeing or being. </p><p><b>Are You Allergic to Life?</b></p><p>Another reason why presence often eludes us is due to our emotional pain, or what I refer to as our allergies to life. It is very difficult to experience presence if you have learned to brace against it or attempt to escape what life presents or triggers in you. <i>Presence</i> isn't about picking and choosing your experience: Yes, I'll be present to this; No, I won't be present to that. The intelligence of life is constantly directing us toward <i>presence</i>. It's our opportunity to experience how life guides us in each and every moment, allowing us to breathe easily. Yet, early-life traumas along with our emotional predispositions cause us to automatically recoil from particular people and situations. We're usually not aware of why this is happening. All we see are people and experiences that feel scary, uncomfortable or overwhelming to us.</p><p>This is where the science of light and life magically unite, because we tend to respond to color in the same way we respond to life. Throughout my career, I found that my patients were allergic to the colors that, on a vibrational level, corresponded to the life experiences they found difficult to process. So when they viewed those colors, they had reactions that affected them physically and emotionally, filling their minds and blocking their connection to <i>presence</i>. Once they used "color homeopathy," which I will explain and demonstrate later in the book, and were able to embrace the colors that previously had caused reactions, they were simultaneously able to experience greater <i>presence</i> with the life experiences that previously triggered them.</p><p><b>What's Catching Your Eye?</b></p><p>I learned a great deal from observing my children when they were very young. Like most children, they often played with toys, leaving them out when they were finished. I repeatedly asked them to put their toys away, which only seemed to work when I insisted. I then had a strong feeling that <i>if I see it, it's my responsibility. </i>I began wondering what would happen if I started responding to everything that <i>caught my eye</i>. So I began an around-the-clock practice that went like this: anything that entered my awareness became my responsibility, anything that was my responsibility I would attend to, and anything I attended to I would complete. I did this practice for a week and didn't let anything get by me; by Sunday, I was picking cigarette butts up off the street. </p><p>After that week, I was a more contented person. I realized how much time I had spent worrying about my circumstances, hoping they would change. But whenever I tried to decide what to do next, there was never any clarity. During this experiment, however, clarity emerged <i>on its own</i>, as whatever called to me became the next logical thing to do<i>. </i>This practice in <i>presence</i>"a kind of <i>moving meditation</i>"made me feel that I no longer needed to prioritize my schedule because <i>life had already done that</i>, drawing my awareness to whatever required its attention. In addition, my presence&#x2015;and in turn, my vision&#x2015;deepened as I stopped ignoring what I was seeing<i>. </i>I had the sense then that ignoring what we see, might actually be at the root of much of the vision loss I saw in my practice. In this book, you will be encouraged to perform an exercise to "see" for yourself just how life-changing something so simple can be. In no time at all, a sense of spaciousness and ease that often eludes you, actualizes. </p><p>I now know that life is continually serving us our curriculum, and if we naturally respond moment-by-moment to what is calling us, we not only will experience an amazing state of grace and presence, but we will develop a real sense of self-respect, knowing that whatever life brings, we will meet it head on. By living <i>choicelessly,</i> we benefit from the guiding compass of the universe, experiencing less stress and more joy, inspiration, love and gratitude. </p><p><b>Merging with Life</b></p><p>My first two books, <i>Light: Medicine Of The Future (1991)</i> and <i>Take Off Your Glasses And See (1995) </i>shared revolutionary ideas, therapeutic modalities and a directory of practitioners who offered these modalities. <i>Luminous Life: How the Science of Light Unlocks the Art of Living </i>combines forty-five years of clinical research and direct experience with contemporary scienceto create a new philosophy of life that can be implemented and integrated by you at home, resulting in transformation that is rapid, significant and permanent. </p><p><i>Luminous Life</i> explores the connection between light, vision and consciousness and its inseparable impact on <i>presence</i>.

Street photography is at the heart of what makes photography unique.<br>An unprecedented study that is the first history of this tradition ever published, Bystander explores street photography through a discussion of the medium's masters - Atget, Stieglitz, Strand, Cartier-Bresson, Brassai, Kertesz, Evans, Levitt, Frank, Arbus, Winogrand, and many others - and reveals along the way much about the craft and creative process of photography. Profusely illustrated with the work of more than eighty photographers, the book is composed of four parts separated by lively folios of pictures. Each part discusses a different era - from the early days of the medium in nineteenth-century Europe, to America in the late twentieth century - and devotes entire chapters to the key figures of that period.</p><p>COLIN WESTERBECK is curator of photography at the Rat Institute of Chicago.JOEL MEYEROWITZ is best known for his large-format colour work but began his career as a street photographer in the 1960&#39;s.This substantial book embraces the history of street photography as social and cultural document. Generously illustrated with black-and-white photographs as well as a small selection of color images, the book touches upon the work of acknowledged masters such as Henri Cartier-Bresson, Andre Kertesz, Paul Strand, Bill Brandt, Manuel Alvarez Bravo, and many others. Farm Security Administration photographers, including Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange, also receive their due along with contemporary American photographers Weegee (Arthur Fellig), Gary Winogrand, Lee Friedlander, Diane Arbus, and Helen Levitt-to name just a few. This ambitious effort is perhaps most successful in bringing together the work of these classic photographers in a thoughtful, coherent study of this fascinating genre of photography. Westerbeck is associate curator of at the Art Institute of Chicago and Meyerowitz is a photographer (Bay/Sky, LJ 12/93).

Rejecting the century's predominant philosophical focus on temporality, Sloterdijk, a self-described &#x201c;student of the air,&#x201d; reinterprets the history of Western metaphysics as an inherently spatial and immunological project, from the discovery of self (bubble) to the exploration of world (globe) to the poetics of plurality (foam). Exploring macro- and micro-space from the Greek agora to the contemporary urban apartment, Sloterdijk is able to synthesize, with immense erudition, the spatial theories of Aristotle, Ren� Descartes, Gaston Bachelard, Walter Benjamin, and Georges Bataille into a morphology of shared, or multipolar, dwelling&#x2015;identifying the question of being as one bound up with the aerial technology of architectonics and anthropogenesis.</p><p>Sloterdijk describes Bubbles, the first volume of Spheres, as a general theory of the structures that allow couplings&#x2015;or as the book's original intended subtitle put it, an &#x201c;archeology of the intimate.&#x201d; Bubbles includes a wide array of images, not to illustrate Sloterdijk's discourse, but to offer a spatial and visual &#x201c;parallel narrative&#x201d; to his exploration of bubbles.</p><p>Written over the course of a decade, the Spheres trilogy has waited another decade for its much-anticipated English translation from Semiotext(e). Volumes II, Globes, and III, Foam, will be published in the coming seasons.</p></p><p>Peter Sloterdijk (b. 1947) is one of the best known and widely read German intellectuals writing today. His 1983 publication of <i>Critique of Cynical Reason</i> (published in English in 1988) became the best-selling German book of philosophy since World War II. He became president of the State Academy of Design at the Center for Art and Media in Karlsruhe in 2001. He has been cohost of a discussion program, <i>Das Philosophische Quartett</i> (Philosophical Quartet) on German television since 2002.<p>...<i>Bubbles</i> is as much an essential guide to modern space as it is a philosophical epic about dwelling and thinking.</p>&#x2015;<b>Brian Dillon</b>, <i>The Guardian</i><br><br><p>[<i>Bubbles</i>] is perhaps best read as a long philosophical poem, powerfully expressive of the modern experience of disorientation and loneliness, wrenching itself into bizarre shapes in its imperfect attempt to conjure an ancient wholeness.</p>&#x2015;<b>Adam Kirsch</b>, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i></p><h2>Coup d&#39;�tat: A Practical Handbook</h2><p>The coup is the most frequently attempted method of changing government, and the most successful. <i>Coup d&#x2019;�tat</i> outlines the mechanism of the coup and analyzes the conditions&#x2015;political, military, and social, that gives rise to it. In doing so, the book sheds much light on societies where power does indeed grow out of the barrel of a gun and the role of law is a concept little understood.</p><p>Edward N. Luttwak serves or has served as a contractor for the Office of Net Assessment of the U.S. Department of Defense and for the U.S. armed forces, and as a consultant to the U.S. National Security Council, the White House Chief of Staff, and several allied governments.This short book is...wicked, truthful, and entertaining. The author, after outlining a step-by-step procedure for bringing about a coup, analyzes modern (post&#x2013;Second World War) coups, and points out why some succeeded and others failed. (<i>New Yorker</i>)<br><br>An extraordinarily competent and well-written work, displaying very wide knowledge of the ways in which coups, both successful and unsuccessful, have actually been organized. (<i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br><i>Coup d'�tat</i> demonstrates that scholarly analysis can be good social science and at the same time fun to read. It is nontechnical in approach and informal in style... Moreover, Edward Luttwak's familiarity with the basic concepts and problems of political science is evident throughout. He is seldom superficial and never trivial in his treatment of his subject. The result is a book of value to everyone interested in the sudden changes of government that occur so frequently in many parts of the world and also curious as to why they so often seem to result in more of the same... We can all have the satisfaction of understanding the strategies and techniques employed, and we can enjoy learning them from this lucid and witty book.

He gained national attention as a humorist in 1865 with the publication of "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County," but was acknowledged as a great writer by the literary establishment with <i>The Adventures Of Huckleberry Fin</i>n (1885). In 1880, Twain began promoting and financing the ill-fated Paige typesetter, an invention designed to make the printing process fully automatic. At the height of his naively optimistic involvement in the technological "wonder" that nearly drove him to bankruptcy, he published his satire, <i>A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court</i> (1889). Plagued by personal tragedy and financial failure, Mark Twain spent the last years of his life in gloom and exasperation, writing fables about "the damned human race."CHAPTER I<br><br>PUDD'NHEAD WINS HIS NAME<br><i>Tell the truth or trump&#x2013;but get the trick</i>.&#x2013;pudd'nhead wilson's calendar.<br>THE SCENE of this chronicle is the town of Dawson's Landing, on the Missouri side of the Mississippi, half a day's journey, per steamboat, below St. Louis.<br><br>In 1830 it was a snug little collection of modest one and two-story frame dwellings whose whitewashed exteriors were almost concealed from sight by climbing tangles of rose vines, honeysuckles, and morning-glories. Each of these pretty homes had a garden in front fenced with white palings, and opulently stocked with hollyhocks, marigolds, touch-me-nots, prince's-feathers, and other old-fashioned flowers; while on the window-sills of the houses stood wooden boxes containing moss-rose plants and terra-cotta pots in which grew a breed of geranium whose spread of intensely red blossoms accented the prevailing pink tint of the rose-clad house-front like an explosion of flame. When there was room on the ledge outside of the pots and boxes for a cat, the cat was there--in sunny weather--stretched at full length, asleep and blissful, with her furry belly to the sun and a paw curved over her nose. Then that house was complete, and its contentment and peace were made manifest to the world by this symbol, whose testimony is infallible. A home without a cat--and a well-fed, well-petted and properly revered cat--may be a perfect home, perhaps, but how can it prove title?<br><br>All along the streets, on both sides, at the outer edge of the brick sidewalks, stood locust trees with trunks protected by wooden boxing, and these furnished shade for summer and a sweet fragrance in spring when the clusters of buds came forth. The main street, one block back from the river, and running parallel with it, was the sole business street. It was six blocks long, and in each block two or three brick stores three stories high towered above interjected bunches of little frame shops. <br><br>Swinging signs creaked in the wind, the street's whole length. The candy-striped pole, which indicates nobility proud and ancient along the palace-bordered canals of Venice, indicated merely the humble barber shop along the main street of Dawson's Landing. On a chief corner stood a lofty unpainted pole wreathed from top to bottom with tin pots and pans and cups, the chief tinmonger's noisy notice to the world (when the wind blew) that his shop was on hand for business at that corner.<br><br>The hamlet's front was washed by the clear waters of the great river; its body stretched itself rearward up a gentle incline; its most rearward border fringed itself out and scattered its houses about the baseline of the hills; the hills rose high, inclosing the town in a half-moon curve, clothed with forests from foot to summit.<br><br>Steamboats passed up and down every hour or so. Those belonging to the little Cairo line and the little Memphis line always stopped; the big Orleans liners stopped for hails only, or to land passengers or freight; and this was the case also with the great flotilla of "transients." These latter came out of a dozen rivers--the Illinois, the Missouri, the Upper Mississippi, the Ohio, the Monongahela, the Tennessee, the Red River, the White River, and so on; and were bound every whither and stocked with every imaginable comfort or necessity which the Mississippi's communities could want, from the frosty Falls of St. Anthony down through nine climates to torrid New Orleans.<br><br>Dawson's Landing was a slaveholding town, with a rich slave-worked grain and pork country back of it. The town was sleepy and comfortable and contented. It was fifty years old, and was growing slowly--very slowly, in fact, but still it was growing.<br><br>The chief citizen was York Leicester Driscoll, about forty years old, judge of the county court. He was very proud of his old Virginian ancestry, and in his hospitalities and his rather formal and stately manners he kept up its traditions. He was fine and just and generous. To be a gentleman--a gentleman without stain or blemish--was his only religion, and to it he was always faithful. He was respected, esteemed, and beloved by all the community. He was well off, and was gradually adding to his store. He and his wife were very nearly happy, but not quite, for they had no children. The longing for the treasure of a child had grown stronger and stronger as the years slipped away, but the blessing never came--and was never to come.<br><br>With this pair lived the Judge's widowed sister, Mrs. Rachel Pratt, and she also was childless--childless, and sorrowful for that reason, and not to be comforted. The women were good and commonplace people, and did their duty and had their reward in clear consciences and the community's approbation. They were Presbyterians, the Judge was a free-thinker.<br><br>Pembroke Howard, lawyer and bachelor, aged about forty, was another old Virginian grandee with proved descent from the First Families. He was a fine, brave, majestic creature, a gentleman according to the nicest requirements of the Virginia rule, a devoted Presbyterian, an authority on the "code," and a man always courteously ready to stand up before you in the field if any act or word of his had seemed doubtful or suspicious to you, and explain it with any weapon you might prefer from brad-awls to artillery. He was very popular with the people, and was the Judge's dearest friend.<br><br>Then there was Colonel Cecil Burleigh Essex, another F. F. V. of formidable caliber--however, with him we have no concern.<br><br>Percy Northumberland Driscoll, brother to the Judge, and younger than he by five years, was a married man, and had had children around his hearthstone; but they were attacked in detail by measles, croup, and scarlet fever, and this had given the doctor a chance with his effective antediluvian methods; so the cradles were empty. He was a prosperous man, with a good head for speculations, and his fortune was growing. On the 1st of February, 1830, two boy babes were born in his house; one to him, the other to one of his slave girls, Roxana by name. Roxana was twenty years old. She was up and around the same day, with her hands full, for she was tending both babies.<br><br>Mrs. Percy Driscoll died within the week. Roxy remained in charge of the children. She had her own way, for Mr. Driscoll soon absorbed himself in his speculations and left her to her own devices.<br><br>In that same month of February, Dawson's Landing gained a new citizen. This was Mr. David Wilson, a young fellow of Scotch parentage. He had wandered to this remote region from his birthplace in the interior of the state of New York, to seek his fortune. He was twenty-five years old, college-bred, and had finished a post-college course in an Eastern law school a couple of years before.<br><br>He was a homely, freckled, sandy-haired young fellow, with an intelligent blue eye that had frankness and comradeship in it and a covert twinkle of a pleasant sort. But for an unfortunate remark of his, he would no doubt have entered at once upon a successful career at Dawson's Landing. But he made his fatal remark the first day he spent in the village, and it "gaged" him. He had just made the acquaintance of a group of citizens when an invisible dog began to yelp and snarl and howl and make himself very comprehensively disagreeable, whereupon young Wilson said, much as one who is thinking aloud:<br><br>"I wish I owned half of that dog."<br><br>"Why?" somebody asked.<br><br>"Because I would kill my half."<br><br>The group searched his face with curiosity, with anxiety even, but found no light there, no expression that they could read. They fell away from him as from something uncanny, and went into privacy to discuss him. One said:<br><br>"'Pears to be a fool."<br><br>"'Pears?" said another. "Is, I reckon you better say."<br><br>"Said he wished he owned half of the dog, the idiot," said a third. "What did he reckon would become of the other half if he killed his half? Do you reckon he thought it would live?"<br><br>"Why, he must have thought it, unless he is the down-rightest fool in the world; because if he hadn't thought it, he would have wanted to own the whole dog, knowing that if he killed his half and the other half died, he would be responsible for that half just the same as if he had killed that half instead of his own. Don't it look that way to you, gents?"<br><br>"Yes, it does. If he owned one half of the general dog, it would be so; if he owned one end of the dog and another person owned the other end, it would be so, just the same; particularly in the first case, because if you kill one half of a general dog, there ain't any man that can tell whose half it was, but if he owned one end of the dog, maybe he could kill his end of it and--"<br><br>"No, he couldn't, either; he couldn't and not be responsible if the other end died, which it would. In my opinion the man ain't in his right mind."<br><br>"In my opinion he hain't got any mind."<br><br>No. 3 said: "Well, he's a lummox, anyway."<br><br>"That's what he is," said No. 4, "he's a labrick--just a Simon-pure labrick, if ever there was one."<br><br>"Yes, sir, he's a dam fool, that's the way I put him up," said No. 5. "Anybody can think different that wants to, but those are my sentiments."<br><br>"I'm with you, gentlemen," said No. 6. "Perfect jackass--yes, and it ain't going too far to say he is a pudd'nhead. If he ain't a pudd'nhead, I ain't no judge, that's all."<br><br>Mr. Wilson stood elected. The incident was told all over the town, and gravely discussed by everybody. Within a week he had lost his first name; Pudd'nhead took its place. In time he came to be liked, and well liked, too; but by that time the nickname had got well stuck on, and it stayed. <br><br>That first day's verdict made him a fool, and he was not able to get it set aside, or even modified. The nickname soon ceased to carry any harsh or unfriendly feeling with it, but it held its place, and was to continue to hold its place for twenty long years.<br>CHAPTER II<br><br>DRISCOLL SPARES HIS SLAVES<br><i>Adam was but human&#x2013;this explains it all. He did not want the apple for the apple's sake, he wanted it only because it was forbidden. The mistake was in not forbidding the serpent: then he would have eaten the serpent.</i>&#x2013;pudd'nhead wilson's calendar.<br><br>PUDD'NHEAD WILSON had a trifle of money when he arrived, and he bought a small house on the extreme western verge of the town. Between it and Judge Driscoll's house there was only a grassy yard, with a paling fence dividing the properties in the middle. He hired a small office down in the town and hung out a tin sign with these words on it:<br>DAVID WILSON<br>attorney and counselor-at-law<br>surveying, conveyancing, etc.<br>But his deadly remark had ruined his chance--at least in the law. No clients came. He took down his sign after a while and put it up on his own house with the law features knocked out of it. It offered his services now in the humble capacities of land-surveyor and expert accountant. Now and then he got a job of surveying to do, and now and then a merchant got him to straighten out his books. With Scotch patience and pluck he resolved to live down his reputation and work his way into the legal field yet. Poor fellow! he could not foresee that it was going to take him such a weary long time to do it.<br><br>He had a rich abundance of idle time, but it never hung heavy on his hands, for he interested himself in every new thing that was born into the universe of ideas, and studied it and experimented upon it at his house. One of his pet fads was palmistry. To another one he gave no name, neither would he explain to anybody what its purpose was, but merely said it was an amusement. In fact, he had found that his fads added to his reputation as a pudd'nhead; therefore he was growing chary of being too communicative about them. The fad without a name was one which dealt with people's finger-marks. He carried in his coat pocket a shallow box with grooves in it, and in the grooves strips of glass five inches long and three inches wide. Along the lower edge of each strip was pasted a slip of white paper. He asked people to pass their hands through their hair (thus collecting upon them a thin coating of the natural oil) and then make a thumb-mark on a glass strip, following it with the mark of the ball of each finger in succession. Under this row of faint grease-prints he would write a record on the strip of white paper--thus:<br>John Smith, right hand--<br>and add the day of the month and the year, then take Smith's left hand on another glass strip, and add name and date and the words "left hand." The strips were now returned to the grooved box, and took their place among what Wilson called his "records."<br><br>He often studied his records, examining and poring over them with absorbing interest until far into the night; but what he found there--if he found anything--he revealed to no one. Sometimes he copied on paper the involved and delicate pattern left by the ball of a finger, and then vastly enlarged it with a pantograph so that he could examine its web of curving lines with ease and convenience.<br><br>One sweltering afternoon--it was the first day of July, 1830--he was at work over a set of tangled account-books in his workroom, which looked westward over a stretch of vacant lots, when a conversation outside disturbed him. It was carried on in yells, which showed that the people engaged in it were not close together:<br><br>"Say, Roxy, how does yo' baby come on?" This from the distant voice.<br><br>"Fust-rate; how does you come on, Jasper?" This yell was from close by.<br><br>"Oh, I's middlin'; hain't got noth'n' to complain of. I's gwine to come a-court'n' you bimeby, Roxy."<br><br>"You is, you black mudcat! Yah--yah--yah! I got some-p'n' better to do den 'sociat'n' wid niggers as black as you is. Is ole Miss Cooper's Nancy done give you de mitten?" Roxy followed this sally with another discharge of carefree laughter.<br><br>"You's jealous, Roxy, dat's what's de matter wid you, you hussy--yah--yah--yah! Dat's de time I got you!"<br><br>"Oh, yes, you got me, hain't you. 'Clah to goodness if dat conceit o' yo'n strikes in, Jasper, it gwine to kill you sho'. If you b'longed to me I'd sell you down de river 'fo' you git too fur gone. Fust time I runs acrost yo' marster, I's gwine to tell him so."</p><h2>Math Games &amp; Activities from Around the World</h2><p>More than 70 math games, puzzles, and projects from all over the world are included in this delightful book for kids.<br></p><p>Claudia Zaslavsky has been a maths teacher and maths teacher&#39;s teacher since 1959 and was one of the first educators to emphasise multicultural perspectives in math.

The Nazi Army is smashing through the Ukraine en route to Moscow. Zhanna and her family are to be executed alongside thousands of others in the ravines of Drobitsky Yar. A few short miles from certain death, her father bribes a nearby guard, and she escapes into the forest with only the clothes on her back, a copy of Chopin&#x2019;s <em>Fantasy Impromptu</em> in her pocket, and her father&#x2019;s parting words echoing in her head: <em>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care what you do, just live.&#x201d;</em><br><br> Adopting a new identity and ever fearful of recognition, Zhanna roamed the ravaged countryside.

Greg has been a journalist for over forty years and has worked for a variety of newspapers, including Boston Herald and Indianapolis Star. Greg is currently a columnist for The Orlando Sentinel. He lives with his wife in Orlando.In this remarkable recreation of the WWII years, Dawson, a columnist at the <i>Orlando Sentinel</i>, writes about his mother, pianist Zhanna Arkashyna in an account reminiscent of Wladyslaw Szpilman's <i>The Pianist</i>. As a child in the Ukraine, Zhanna was offered a scholarship to the Moscow State Conservatory. Her life changed in 1941 when Nazis grouped her Jewish family with thousands to be executed; Zhanna and her sister, Frina, escaped to roam the countryside as fugitives, hiding and surviving. With a new name and a non-Jewish identity, Zhanna performed for unsuspecting Nazis. Arriving in New York in 1946, the sisters enrolled at Juilliard on scholarships. Zhanna married violist David Dawson, and the couple moved in 1948 to Bloomington, Ind., joining the music faculty at Indiana University. To research his mother's homeland, Dawson traveled to Ukraine, including Dorbitsky Yar, where 15,000 Jews were murdered, among them Zhanna and Frina's parents. On a memorial listing the dead, Dawson was shocked to find his mother's name: I had come that close to nonexistence. With italicized selections from his mother's own writing, Dawson skillfully weaves the story of her life and music into a vibrant tapestry, tattered and torn, yet triumphant. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A star researcher at the world-renowned Bell Laboratories in New Jersey, he claimed to have stumbled across a powerful method for making carbon-based crystals into transistors, the switches found on computer chips. Had his experiments worked, they would have paved the way for huge advances in technology--computer chips that we could stick on a dress or eyewear, or even use to make electronic screens as thin and easy-to-fold as sheets of paper. But as other researchers tried to recreate Sch�n&#39;s experiments, the scientific community learned that it had been duped. Why did so many top experts, including Nobel prize-winners, support Sch�n? What led the major scientific journals to publish his work, and promote it with press releases? And what drove Sch�n, by all accounts a mild-mannered, modest and obliging young man, to tell such outra</p><p><p><b>Eugenie Samuel Reich</b> is a former editor at <i>New Scientist</i>.

Bruce Sterling's 1988 book, <i>Islands in the Net</i>, is a thrilling blend of high tech and low humanity. The glue that binds together this world of data pirates, mercenaries, nanotechnology, weaponry, and post-millennial voodoo is the global electronic net. You'll find jarring references to pre-Microsoft Windows computer technology, the Soviet Union, and that fancy new wonder machine--the fax. But this book has enough cool stuff to keep even a jaded cyberpunk interested. The characters are far more than mere constructs used to show off the technology, and the plot is fast, complicated, and mysterious. Veteran Sterling fans will enjoy this taste of his pre-fame style.A war between data pirates involves a young woman and her husband in a desperate search for a new kind of international terrorist.

Hollow? Then this six-session video Bible study (DVD sold separately) is for you! Bestselling author Anne Graham Lotz looks at the life of Daniel and unpacks the prayer he prayed in Daniel 9. Unlike the everyday now-I-lay-me-down-to-sleep kind of prayer, this was a prayer birthed under heartache...grief...desperation. It was a plea for Heaven to move and change his nation.&nbsp;</p><p>For an entire generation, Daniel's people had been held in captivity and separated from their homeland&#x2013;and thus separated from God. But when Daniel read a prophecy in which God said He would restore His people to Jerusalem after seventy years, he claimed that promise and cried out to the Lord to bring it to pass. Daniel's example of praying God's Word back to Him is what Anne calls "reversed thunder."&nbsp;</p><p>In this study, Anne explains how we, too, can reverse the thunder until Heaven is moved and our own worlds change. Following the pattern of Daniel's original prayer, she helps us develop a more meaningful and powerful prayer life. As we learn how to storm the gates of Heaven and refuse to let go, we will see real change in the lives of not only those we are praying for, but also our own. Our prayers will become more effective as our faith is deepened and our personal relationship with God is strengthened.&nbsp;</p><p>This guide includes weekly Bible study readings, video teaching notes, group discussion questions, group activities, and space for writing your own prayers.

With hundreds of brilliantly detailed maps, photographs, and drawings, and chronologies and commentaries by leading experts, <b>A Historical Atlas of the Jewish People</b> is both an authoritative reference work and a sumptuous gift volume.</p><p><i>A Historical Atlas of the Jewish People</i>, edited by Eli Barnavi, is one of those rare books that can literally make a reader gasp with delight and horror. It may even be the best one-volume history of Judaism in print. Beginning with "The Migrations of the Patriarchs," and continuing to the present day, the book's chapters include historical maps, timelines, illustrations and photographs, and narrative essays by leading historians (such as Moshe Idel) that help readers not only understand but visualize the movements of the Jewish people. The editors have chosen not to structure the story as leading inexorably to the Holocaust and the rise of Israel, although both events are covered in some detail. Instead, they have depicted the rich variety of lives established by the Diaspora in such far-flung places as China and England, and have been equally attentive to the joys and triumphs of Jews, both in everyday life and in national cultures, as to the considerable tragedies Jews have endured. The text of this book is smart and readable, but the real joy of the atlas is its illustrations, many of which are rarely seen, such as 20th-century artist Abel Pann's depiction of the creation of Adam, "He breathed into his nostrils the breath of life." It's the kind of image that reminds you that life really is a gift, and makes you savor it. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>"Publishing an atlas purporting to cover the history of the Jewish people from antiquity to the present is a courageous, even audacious act....Yet, this atlas succeeds beautifully in doing just that."<br>-- Jehuda Reinharz, President, Brandeis University</p><h2>I Don&#39;t Want to Be an Empath Anymore: How to Reclaim Your Power Over Emotional Overload, Maintain Boundaries, and Live Your Best Life</h2><p><p><b>Do you feel <i>all</i> the feels&#x2014;<i>all</i> the time?

If so, this book is for you.</b></p><p><i>I Don&#x2019;t Want to Be an Empath Anymore</i> is a gift for the jaded empath searching for authenticity in spirituality, and spirituality in being authentic&#x2014;something beyond the clich�d, positive affirmations that seem to invalidate our anger, sadness, and pain. When we feel broken&#x2014;and when real damage has been done, it&#x2019;s not always helpful to ignore our feelings and tell ourselves that we are perfect and whole.</p><p>In this refreshingly honest guide, shamanic practitioner Ora North offers practical exercises to help you navigate your intuition and empathic sensitivities, create much-needed boundaries, and build confidence. You&#x2019;ll also learn to balance your emotions and energy, and harness the strength of your shadow side to embrace your whole self and live your best life.</p><p>Like the Japanese craft known as Kintsugi&#x2014;the art of repairing broken pottery using a lacquer dusted with powdered gold&#x2014;the process of acknowledging and repairing our fragmented selves can make us even more beautiful than before, cracks and all.

Now she works with other empaths, guiding them to explore their own shadows on the path to wholeness.<br><br><b>Danielle Dulsky</b> is author of <i>The Holy Wild </i>and <i>Woman Most Wild</i>.&#x201c;Ora North brings a raw and powerful look at the reality of being an empath. It&#x2019;s not always glitter and unicorns; we must take a long, hard look at the wounds and shadows we hold; we must get real to heal. Ora skillfully guides us through this process so we can take off the spiritual mask and claim our true power as empaths.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<b>Lisa Campion</b>, Reiki master teacher, and author of <i>The Art of Psychic Reiki</i> -- Lisa Campion<br><br>&#x201c;What a relief this book is! At turns fresh, familiar, frank, and funny, author Ora North manages to distill recovery models, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and shamanism into a coherent and accessible program for empathy management, self-healing, and relationship building. Don&#x2019;t take the title seriously, though. After working the exercises in <i>I Don</i><i>&#x2019;</i><i>t Want to Be an Empath Anymore</i>, you will not only be more comfortable being so deep in the world of emotion, you will have become adept at it and found yourself embracing what an asset your sensitivities are to yourself and others.

The author speaks volumes to the various aspects of being an empath in our culture, such as the dangers of the &#x2018;positive vibe only&#x2019; complacency, past trauma, and the neglect of certain emotions. She offers innovative exercises such as listing your victims and villains of your shadow self, a formula to write your own pain alchemy affirmation, throwing yourself a pity party, and creating voluntary energetic blindness.

In what a wild hour of madness he had killed his friend! How ghastly the mere memory of the scene! He saw it all again. Each hideous detail came back to him with added horror. Out of the black cave of time, terrible and swathed in scarlet, rose the image of his sin." In their ideal of an exquisitely sensitive temperament that thrills to fine shadings in sensation, the principles of the aesthetic (or "decadent") movement are well suited to the tale of terror. No story exemplifies this better than Oscar Wilde's <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i>. The sparkling wit and zest for life of Wilde's characters combine with cold-blooded acts of horror to generate a deliciously twisted sense of elegance and evil, civilization and degradation. Oscar Wilde, like Edgar Allan Poe, shows us that what we find loathsome and frightening can also be beautiful.8 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>INVESTIGATIONS 2017 STUDENT ACTIVITY BOOK GRADE 3</h2><p>New, never used!</p><p></p><h2>The Sacred Slow: A Holy Departure from Fast Faith</h2><p><p><strong>52 Experiences in Unhurried Honesty with God</strong></p><p>If yesterday&#x2019;s word was &#x201c;simple,&#x201d; tomorrow&#x2019;s word will be &#x201c;slow.&#x201d;</p><p>Our culture is shifting from fast food to health food both physically and spiritually.

Why has the US Supreme Court accepted the validity of same-sex "marriage", which, until a decade ago, was unheard of in the history of Western or any other civilization? Where has the "gay rights" movement come from, and how has it so easily conquered America?</p><p>The answers are in the dynamics of the rationalization of sexual misbehavior. The power of rationalization the means by which one mentally transforms wrong into right drives the gay rights movement, gives it its revolutionary character, and makes its advocates indefatigable. The homosexual cause moved naturally from a plea for tolerance to cultural conquest because the security of its rationalization requires universal acceptance. In other words, we all must say that the bad is good.</p><p>At stake in the rationalization of homosexual behavior is the notion that human beings are ordered to a purpose that is given by their Nature. The understanding that things have an in-built purpose is being replaced by the idea that everything is subject to man's will and power, which is considered to be without limits. This is what the debate over homosexuality is really about the Nature of reality itself.</p><p>The outcome of this dispute will have consequences that reach far beyond the issue at hand. Already America's major institutions have been transformed its courts, its schools, its military, its civic institutions, and even its diplomacy. The further institutionalization of homosexuality will mean the triumph of force over reason, thus undermining the very foundations of the American Republic.</p><p>"Robert Reilly shows that to go with the flow of the homosexual movement is to go against nature, science, children, marriage, the family and the common good; in fact to go against common sense. This movement is now the leader of a long-term pack working to undermine society, a process designed to bring chaos (see Gramschi) and dictatorship before freedom is enjoyed again. The time and the means to oppose are both narrowing. If this book does not move you to action nothing will."<br><b>-- Patrick F. Fagan, PhD</b>, Senior Fellow, Family Research Council</p><p>"Plato teaches that societies take on the features and tastes of the persons most prominent in them. Reilly shows how America's ruling class is shaping our society according to its taste for homosexuality and its distaste for natural families. If you want to know the philosophical and legal background of the revolution that is being imposed upon America and its consequences read this book."<br><b>-- Angelo M. Codevilla , PhD</b> Professor Emeritus, Boston University; Author, <i>The Character of Nations</i></p><p>"This book is magnificent, a real achievement. For anyone interested in taking our country back from the sexual radicals, you must know how they did it, so rapidly, efficiently, even brutally. The gay rights movement slid through American institutions, both public and private, like a hot knife through butter. I suspect it has surprised even its proponents to see how fast we have capitulated. First philosophy fell, then psychology, the courts, education, the military and even the Boy Scouts followed. No one has told both the broad sweep and the specific details of this story better than Robert Reilly."<br><b>-- Austin Ruse</b> President, Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute</p><p>"The mainstreaming of sodomistic practice is a sign that a culture has lost not only its faith but also its mind. Robert Reilly patiently and convincingly explains how that flight from reason occurred and what can be done about it."<br><b>-- Charles E.

His previous book is <em>The Closing of the Muslim Mind: How Intellectual Suicide Created the Modern Islamist Crisis</em>"If you read only one book on homosexuality, natural law theory, and the radical changes now being instituted within our culture, let it be this one!<p></p><p>Reilly exposes the unscientific reasons why homosexuality was normalized in the [American Psychiatric Association] diagnostic manual. He offers us some intriguing new material. In a clear, systematic, and engaging style, Reilly show us the inherent futility of same-sex acts, and eloquently explains what marriage really is. This book should be required reading for anyone who writes our laws in fact, for anyone with cultural decision-making power. We must not allow the surging political tides to obscure what you and I 'can't not know' about the nature and purpose of sexuality." --<b>Joseph Nicolosi, PhD</b> Co-Founder, National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH)<br><br>"Reilly has drawn on his extensive knowledge of classical political philosophy to explain the full scope of the dangers inherent in the modern homosexual rights movement. The movement threatens our very understanding of human nature, and hence of the American political regime that derives its understanding of rights and legitimate government from that nature. This book is a stark warning that should be read by every lover of liberty, and a call to action for those who would preserve it." --<b>John C. Eastman, JD, PhD</b> Chairman, National Organization for Marriage Founding Director, Claremont Institute Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence<br><br>"In our society, homosexuality has become more than a 'sexual orientation'. It has now grown into a far-reaching movement seeking to redefine not only morality, but ideas about biology, human nature, law, and politics indeed, to declare opposing views as beyond the pale of civilization. Robert Reilly has the multiple talents necessary to address the full range of relevant issues, from the philosophical to the practical. A rare tour de force on a defining question of our time." --<b>Robert Royal, PhD</b> President, Faith &amp; Reason Institute</p></p><h2>FYI: For Your Improvement; A Development and Coaching Guide (1st Edition) (The Leadership Architect Suite)</h2><p>A Development and Coaching Guide for Learners, Supervisors, Managers, Mentors and Feedback Givers</p><p></p><h2>Big Girl: A Novel</h2><p>In this heartfelt and incisive new novel, Danielle Steel celebrates the virtues of unconventional beauty while exploring deeply resonant issues of weight, self-image, sisterhood, and family.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A chubby little girl with blond hair, blue eyes, and ordinary looks, Victoria Dawson has always felt out of place in her family, especially in body-conscious L.A. Her father, Jim, is tall and slender, and her mother, Christina, is a fine-boned, dark-haired beauty. Both are self-centered, outspoken, and disappointed by their daughter&#x2019;s looks. When Victoria is six, she sees a photograph of Queen Victoria, and her father has always said she looks just like her. After the birth of Victoria&#x2019;s perfect younger sister, Gracie, her father liked to refer to his firstborn as &#x201c;our tester cake.&#x201d; With Gracie, everyone agreed that Jim and Christina got it right.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While her parents and sister can eat anything and not gain an ounce, Victoria must watch everything she eats, as well as endure her father&#x2019;s belittling comments about her body and see her academic achievements go unacknowledged. Ice cream and oversized helpings of all the wrong foods give her comfort, but only briefly. The one thing she knows is that she has to get away from home, and after college in Chicago, she moves to New York City. <br><br>Landing her dream job as a high school teacher, Victoria loves working with her students and wages war on her weight at the gym. Despite tension with her parents, Victoria remains close to her sister. And though they couldn&#x2019;t be more different in looks, they love each other unconditionally. But regardless of her accomplishments, Victoria&#x2019;s parents know just what to say to bring her down. She will always be her father&#x2019;s &#x201c;big girl,&#x201d; and her mother&#x2019;s constant disapproval is equally unkind.<br><br>When Grace announces her engagement to a man who is an exact replica of their narcissistic father, Victoria worries about her sister&#x2019;s future happiness, and with no man of her own, she feels like a failure once again. As the wedding draws near, a chance encounter, an act of stunning betrayal, and a family confrontation lead to a turning point. <br><br>Behind Victoria is a lifetime of hurt and neglect she has tried to forget, and even ice cream can no longer dull the pain. Ahead is a challenge and a risk: to accept herself as she is, celebrate it, and claim the victories she has fought so hard for and deserves.

He was an only child, tall for his age, had a perfect physique, and was an exceptional athlete as he grew older, and the hub of his parents&#x2019; world. They were both in their forties when he was born, and he was a blessing and surprise, after years of trying to have a child. They had given up hope, and then their perfect baby boy appeared. His mother looked at him adoringly as she held him in her arms. His father loved to play ball with him. He was the star of his Little League team, and as he grew older, the girls swooned over him in school. He had dark hair and velvety brown eyes and a pronounced cleft in his chin, like a movie star. He was captain of the football team in college, and no one was surprised when he dated the homecoming queen, a pretty girl whose family had moved to southern California from Atlanta in freshman year. She was petite and slim with hair and eyes as dark as his, and skin like Snow White. She was gentle and soft spoken and in awe of him. They got engaged the night of graduation and married on Christmas the same year.<br><br>Jim had a job in an ad agency by then, and Christine spent the six months after graduation preparing for their wedding. She had gotten her bachelor&#x2019;s degree, but her only real interest during her four years in college was finding a husband and getting married. And they were a dazzling pair with their flawless all-American good looks. They were a perfect complement to each other and reminded all who saw them like a couple on the cover of a magazine.<br><br>Christine had wanted to model after they were married, but Jim wouldn&#x2019;t hear of it. He had a good job, and made a good salary, and he didn&#x2019;t want his wife to work. What would people think of him if she did? That he wasn&#x2019;t able to provide for her? He wanted her at home and waiting for him every night, which was what she did. And people who knew them said they were the best-looking couple they had ever seen.<br><br>There was never any question about who wore the pants in the family. Jim made the rules, and Christine was comfortable that way. Her own mother had died when she was very young. And Jim&#x2019;s mother, whom Christine called Mother Dawson, sang her son&#x2019;s praises constantly. And Christine readily revered him just as his parents had. He was a good provider, a loving husband, fun to be with, a perfect athlete, and he rose steadily in importance in the ad agency. He was friendly and charming with people, as long as they admired him and didn&#x2019;t criticize him. But most people had no reason to. Jim was a personable young man, he made friends easily, and he put his wife on a pedestal and took good care of her. All he expected of her was to do as he said, worship and adore him, and let him run the show. Her father had had similar ideas, and she&#x2019;d been perfectly brought up to be the devoted wife of a man like him. Their life was everything she had hoped for, and more. There were no unpleasant surprises with Jim, no strange behavior, no disappointments. He protected her and took care of her, and provided handsomely. And their relationship worked perfectly for both of them. Each knew their role in the relationship and played by the rules. He was the Adored, and she the Adorer.<br><br>They were in no hurry to have children for the first few years, and might have waited longer if people hadn&#x2019;t begun to comment about why they didn&#x2019;t have them. It felt like criticism to Jim, or like the suggestion that maybe they couldn&#x2019;t have them, although they both enjoyed their independence without children to tie them down. Jim took her on weekend trips frequently, they went on fun vacations, and he took her out to dinner once or twice a week, although Christine was a good cook and had learned to make his favorite meals. Neither of them was suffering from the lack of children, although they agreed that they wanted them eventually. But five years after they got married, even Jim&#x2019;s parents were beginning to worry that they might be having the same difficulties that had delayed them from having a family for nearly twenty years. Jim assured them that there were no problems, they were just having fun and were in no hurry to have children. They were twenty-seven years old, and enjoying feeling free and unencumbered.<br><br>But the constant inquiries finally got to him, and he told Christine that it was time to start a family. And as she always did, Christine agreed. Whatever Jim thought best seemed right to her too. Christine got pregnant immediately, which was faster than they expected. It was easier than they both had planned, they had assumed it might take six months or a year. And despite her mother-in-law&#x2019;s concerns, the pregnancy was easy for Christine.<br><br>When she went into labor, Jim drove her to the hospital and opted not to be in the delivery room when the baby came, which seemed like the right plan to Christine too. She didn&#x2019;t want him to do anything that would make him ill at ease. He was hoping for a boy, which was her fondest wish too, in order to please him. It didn&#x2019;t even occur to either of them that the baby might be a girl, and they had confidently opted not to find out the baby&#x2019;s sex. As virile as he was, Jim expected his firstborn to be a son, and Christine decorated the nursery in blue. Both of them were absolutely sure it was a boy.<br><br>The baby was in a breech position and had to be delivered by cesarean section, so Christine was still asleep from the anesthetic in the recovery room, when Jim heard the news. And when he saw the baby the nurse presented to him at the nursery window, for a minute, or longer, he thought the baby he was seeing had been switched. The baby had a perfectly round face with chubby cheeks that bore no resemblance to either of them, with a halo of white blond hair. And more shocking than her features or coloring, it was a girl. This was not the baby they had expected, and as she stared at him through the nursery window, all he could think of was that the infant looked like the elderly British monarch Queen Victoria. He said as much to one of the nurses, and she scolded him and said that his daughter was beautiful. Being unfamiliar with the grimaces of newborns, he disagreed. She looked like someone else&#x2019;s child to him, and surely nothing like him or Christine, and he was filled with disappointment as he sat glumly in the waiting room, until they summoned him to Christine. And as soon as she saw the look on his face, she knew that, it was a girl and that in her husband&#x2019;s eyes, she had failed.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a girl?&#x201d; she whispered, still woozy from the anesthetic, as he nodded speechlessly. How was he going to tell his friends that his son had turned out to be a girl? It was a major blow to his ego and image and something he could not control, which never sat well with him. Jim liked to orchestrate everything, and Christine was always willing to play along.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, it&#x2019;s a girl,&#x201d; he finally mustered as a tear squeezed out the corner of Christine&#x2019;s eye. &#x201c;She looks like Queen Victoria.&#x201d; And then he teased Christine a little. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know who the father is, but she looks like she has blue eyes, and she&#x2019;s blond.&#x201d; No one on either side of their families was fair, except his own grandmother, which seemed like a stretch to him. But he didn&#x2019;t doubt Christine. This child was obviously some kind of throwback, in their combined gene pool, but she certainly didn&#x2019;t look like she was theirs. The nurses had been saying that she was very cute, but Jim wasn&#x2019;t convinced. And it was several hours before they brought her to Christine, who gazed at her in wonder as she held her and touched her little hands. She was tightly swaddled in a pink blanket. Christine had just been given a shot to keep her milk from coming in, since she had decided not to nurse. Jim didn&#x2019;t want her to, and she had no desire to either. She wanted to get her figure back as quickly as possible, since Jim had always liked her petite, lithe shape and didn&#x2019;t find her attractive while she was pregnant. She had been careful with her weight during the pregnancy. Like Jim, she found it hard to believe that this chubby white blond baby was theirs. She had long, straight sturdy legs like Jim&#x2019;s. But her features didn&#x2019;t look even remotely familiar to either of them. And Mother Dawson was quick to agree with Jim when she saw her, and said she looked like Jim&#x2019;s paternal grandmother, and said she hoped she didn&#x2019;t look like her later. She had been a round, heavyset woman for her entire life, who had been best known for her cooking and sewing skills and not her looks.<br><br>By the day after her birth, the shock of her being a female had worn off a little, although Jim&#x2019;s friends at the office had teased him that he would have to try again for a son. And Christine was worried that he was angry at her about it, but he very sweetly reassured her that he was glad that she and the baby were healthy, and they&#x2019;d make the best of it. The way he said it made Christine feel as though she had come in second best, and Mother Dawson endorsed that idea. It was no secret that Jim had wanted a son and not a daughter, almost as confirmation of his manhood and ability to father a son. And since it had never dawned on either of them that they might produce a daughter, they had no girls&#x2019; names ready for the chubby blond baby that lay in Christine&#x2019;s arms.<br><br>He had been joking about her looking like Queen Victoria, but they both agreed that they liked the name, and Jim took it one step further, and suggested Regina as a middle name. Victoria Regina Dawson, for Queen Victoria. Victoria the Queen. The name seemed strangely apt as they looked at her, and Christine agreed. She wanted her husband to be happy with the choice of name at least, if not the sex. She still felt as though she had failed him by having a girl. But by the time they left the hospital five days later...</p><h2>Language Lessons for Today Grade 4</h2><p>Language Lessons for Today from My Father's World combines the Charlotte Mason and classical approach to bring homeschoolers short, easy-to-teach lessons that cover basic language skills such as English, punctuation, composition, oral language skills, letter writing, understanding poetry, and more.

For the past nine years, Louisa has suspected that Drake might well be the ideal husband for her, even though he&#x2019;s assiduous in avoiding her. But she&#x2019;s now twenty-seven and enough is enough. She believes propinquity will reveal exactly what it is that lies between them, and what better opportunity to work closely with Drake than this latest mission with which he patently needs her help? Unable to deny Louisa&#x2019;s abilities or the value of her assistance and powerless to curb her willfulness, Drake is forced to grit his teeth and acquiesce to her sticking by his side if only to ensure her safety. But all too soon, his true feelings for her surface sufficiently for her, perspicacious as she is, to see through his denials, which she then interprets as a challenge. Even while they gather information, tease out clues, increasingly desperately search for the missing gunpowder, and doggedly pursue the killer responsible for an ever-escalating tally of dead men, thrown together through the hours, he and she learn to trust and appreciate each other. And fed by constant exposure&#x2014;and blatantly encouraged by her&#x2014;their desires and hungers swell and grow... As the barriers between them crumble, the attraction he has for so long restrained burgeons and balloons, until goaded by her near-death, it erupts, and he seizes her&#x2014;only to be seized in return. Linked irrevocably and with their wills melded and merged by passion&#x2019;s fire, with time running out and the evil mastermind&#x2019;s deadline looming, together, they focus their considerable talents and make one last push to learn the critical truths&#x2014;to find the gunpowder and unmask the villain behind this far-reaching plot. Only to discover that they have significantly less time than they&#x2019;d thought, that the villain&#x2019;s target is even more crucially fundamental to the realm than they&#x2019;d imagined, and it&#x2019;s going to take all that Drake is&#x2014;as well as all that Louisa as Lady Wild can bring to bear&#x2014;to defuse the threat, capture the villain, and make all safe and right again. As they race to the ultimate confrontation, the future of all England rests on their shoulders. <i>Third volume in a trilogy. A historical romance with gothic overtones layered over an intrigue.

So when Robert Smedley walks through the door, determined to prove that his wife is cheating, Raisin Investigations immediately offers to help. Trouble is, Agatha hates divorce cases--especially when the client is as pompous as Smedley--but she has a business to run and she's not about to turn away a paying customer. Unfortunately for Agatha, Mabel Smedley appears to be the perfect wife, young and pretty and a regular volunteer at church. <br>Although Smedley&#x2019;s case doesn&#x2019;t look promising, Agatha&#x2019;s attentions are diverted when she stumbles across the body of missing teenager, Jessica Bradley. In a sudden gesture of kindness (and good public relations), Agatha offers to investigate Jessica&#x2019;s death free of charge. <br>As Agatha juggles her two biggest cases, things are turned upside down when Robert Smedley is found poisoned in his office. The prime suspect, his sainted wife Mabel, immediately hires Agatha to find the real killer. <br>With the help of her old friend, Sir Charles Fraith, and some newly hired staff, Agatha Raisin sets off on another adventure solving crime in the English Cotswolds.<br></p><p><p>AGATHA RAISIN...AND THE CASE FROM HELLShe's nosed in on murder investigations, annoyed law enforcement on two continents, and been targeted by everyone from a hit man to a killer secretary. But now Agatha Raisin must take on her greatest nightmare&#x2015;a divorce case. Bad enough that her struggling detective agency needs the whacking great fee pompous businessman Robert Smedley is offering to prove his wife is unfaithful; it's even worse that Mrs. Smedley is the kind of sweet, accomplished, lovely, gentle, and all-around perfectly wonderful spouse that Agatha couldn't be in a thousand years. So, when Smedley turns up poisoned, Agatha is relieved enough to help his now-desperate wife clear her name. And with the assistance of her firm's eccentric new staff, Agatha enthusiastically follows leads and a batch of suspects through the English countryside's seediest byways. But the police aren't about to let an interfering "amateur" beat them to the punch. And as Agatha hits one dead end after another, a particularly devious killer is looking forward to making sure the indomitable Agatha never has to worry about old age&#x2015;or anything else.</p>Praise for M.

But such a picture of Jesus is far from accurate, according to John Howard Yoder. This watershed work in New Testament ethics leads us to a Savior who was deeply concerned with the agenda of politics and the related issues of power, status, and right relations. By canvassing Luke&#39;s Gospel, Yoder argues convincingly that the true impact of Jesus&#39; life and ministry on his disciples&#39; social behavior points to a specific kind of Christian pacifism in which &#34;the cross of Christ is the model of Christian social efficacy&#34;. This second edition of The Politics of Jesus provides up-to-date interaction with recent publications that touch on Yoder&#39;s timely topic. Following most of the chapters are new &#34;epilogues&#34; summarizing research conducted during the last two decades - research that continues to support the outstanding insights set forth in Yoder&#39;s original work.<b>Christianity Today</b>,&nbsp;<i>Top 10 Books of the 20th Century</i>&nbsp;(2000)<br><br><b>Stanley Hauwerwas in Christian Century</b><br> "I am convinced that when Christians look back on this century of theology in America,&nbsp;<i>The Politics of Jesus</i>&nbsp;will be seen as a new beginning."<br><br><b>Dennis P. McCann</b><br> "When it was first published,&nbsp;<i>The Politics of Jesus</i>&nbsp;effected a&nbsp;<i>coup de grace</i>&nbsp;against neo-orthodox biblical theologies that had managed to depoliticize the ethical significance of Jesus' message. This second edition is no less provocative in contesting the reevaluations of New Testament ethics emerging from recent scholarship on the historical Jesus. Yoder presses beyond the question of whether Jesus was political to ask what sort of politics is the mark of Christian discipleship."<br><br><b>Max L. Stackhouse</b><br> "Although most Catholics, Calvinists, and Christian realists will remain skeptical of Yoder's view of Jesus and of politics, we are always challenged by him. This new edition includes acute responses to many critics.

People are interacting more frequently and more fervently than ever before, turning the English language into an indecipherable mess. Now, this unique and concise compendium presents the most confused and misused words in the language today -- words misused by careless speakers and writers everywhere. It defines, discerns and distinguishes the finer points of sense and meaning. Was it fortuitous or only fortunate? Are you trying to remember, or more fully recollect? Is he uninterested or disinterested? Is it healthful or healthy, regretful or regrettable, notorious or infamous? The answers to these and many more fascinating etymological questions can be found within the pages of this invaluable (or is it valuable?) reference.</p><p>In <i>The Highly Selective Dictionary for the Extraordinarily Literate</i>, Eugene Ehrlich pulls no punches about his intent. This book and its companion, <i>The Highly Selective Thesaurus for the Extraordinarily Literate</i>, are prescriptive rather than descriptive, dedicated to recording language as it should be rather than how it often is. In the preface, Ehrlich announces that he means his book to be an "antidote" to the "effects wrought by the forces of linguistic darkness"--meaning, of course, all lexicographers more permissive than he is. That said, Ehrlich's conservative approach handily disposes of many thorny usage problems. The entry for "effectual," for example, distinguishes between "effective" and "effectual" in a concise and utterly persuasive way: "...a law that is effective--operative, in effect--becomes effectual--answers its purpose--only when the law is enforced." <p> This is not your ordinary dictionary; Ehrlich thinks that defining everyday words with commonly accepted meanings is a massive waste of time. Instead, he concentrates on unusual words or those that present interesting problems. The result is a fascinating dictionary that can be read cover to cover, like a book; do so and your vocabulary may never be the same again.</p>Readers, writers, wordsmiths, verbivores, and logophiles will delight in the clutter-free pages of The Highly Selective Dictionary for the Extraordinarily Literate from renowned lexicographer and author Eugene Ehrlich. Forgoing everyday English words and their definitions, The Highly Selective Dictionary presents only the most interesting words and their concise definitions, and includes short discussions for words most often confused and misused by today&#39;s speakers and writers.

Aladdin is introduced by four pages of facts about Arabia and the history of the tales. In King Arthur, the background segments come between stories and interrupt the narrative. Because each selection is short, there is not much room for character development or majestic language. Throughout both books, sidebars are used to define words, expand on ideas, or present pictures and details about objects, such as a sword or a lamp. These asides often restate what is mentioned in the text and condescend to readers by assuming that they would not have picked up on the meaning from the context. These tidbits also prevent tension and excitement from building because of the interrupted flow. Both titles have average-quality illustrations that depict events in the stories. Librarians looking for beautiful, exciting versions of these classics should turn to Neil Philip's The Arabian Nights (Orchard, 1994) or Rosemary Sutcliff's The Sword and the Circle (Puffin, 1994).<br><i>Cheri Estes, Detroit Country Day School Middle School, Beverly Hills, MI</i><br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Case Against Sugar</h2><p>More than half a billion adults and 40 million children on the planet are obese. Diabetes is a worldwide epidemic. Evidence increasingly shows that these illnesses are linked to the other major Western diseases: hypertension, heart disease, even Alzheimer&#39;s and cancer, and that shockingly, sugar is likely the single root cause. Yet the nutritional advice we receive from public health bodies is muddled, out of date, and frequently contradictory, and in many quarters still promotes the unproven hypothesis that fats are the greatest evil. With expert science and compelling storytelling, Gary Taubes investigates the history of nutritional science which, shaped by a handful of charismatic and misguided individuals, has for a hundred years denied the impact of sugar on our health. He exposes the powerful influence of the food industry which has lobbied for sugar&#39;s ubiquity - the Sugar Association even today promoting &#39;sugar&#39;s goodness&#39; - and the extent that the industry has corrupted essential scientific research. He delves into the science of sugar, exposes conventional thinking that sugar is &#39;empty calories&#39; as a myth, and finds that its addictive pleasures are resulting in worldwide consumption as never experienced before, to devastating effect. The Case Against Sugar is a revelatory read, which will fundamentally change the way we eat.</p><p><b>GARY TAUBES</b> is the author of <i>Why We Get Fat and Good Calories, Bad Calories.</i> He is a former staff writer for <i>Discover</i> and a correspondent for the journal <i>Science. </i>His writing has appeared in <i>The New York Times Magazine, The Atlantic,</i> and <i>Esquire, </i>and has been included in numerous &#x201c;Best of&#x201d; anthologies, including <i>The Best of the Best American Science Writing</i> (2010).

She said her mouth was dry, that she was &#x201c;drink- ing water all the time&#x201d; and was compelled to rise three to four times each night to pass her urine. She felt &#x201c;weak and tired.&#x201d; Her appetite was variable; the bowels constipated and she had a dizzy headache. Belching of gas, a tight feeling in the abdomen, and a &#x201c;burning&#x201d; in the stomach followed her meals. She was short of breath."&nbsp;--Elliott Joslin&#x2019;s diabetes &#x201c;case no. 1,&#x201d; as recorded in the case notes of his clinic.<br><br> Elliott Joslin was a medical student at Harvard in the summer of 1893, working as a clinical clerk at Massachusetts General Hos- pital, when he documented his rst consultation with a diabetic <br> patient. He was still a good three decades removed from becom- ing the most in uential diabetes specialist of the twentieth century. The patient was Mary Higgins, a young immigrant who had arrived from Ireland ve years previously and had been working as a domestic in a Boston suburb. She had &#x201c;a severe form of diabetes mellitus,&#x201d; Joslin noted, and her kidneys were already &#x201c;succumbing to the strain put upon them&#x201d; by the disease. <br><br> Joslin&#x2019;s interest in diabetes dated to his undergraduate days at Yale, but it may have been Higgins who catalyzed his obsession. Over the next ve years, Joslin and Reginald Fitz, a renowned Har- vard pathologist, would comb through the &#x201c;hundreds of volumes&#x201d; of handwritten case notes of the Massachusetts General Hospital, looking for information that might shed light on the cause of the disease and perhaps suggest how to treat it. Joslin would travel twice to Europe, visiting medical centers in Germany and Austria, to learn from the most in uential diabetes experts of the era.&nbsp; <br>In 1898, the same year Joslin established his private practice to specialize in the treatment of diabetics, he and Fitz presented their analysis of the Mass General case notes at the annual meeting of the American Medical Association in Denver. They had exam- ined the record of every patient treated at the hospital since 1824. What they saw, although they didn&#x2019;t recognize it at the time, was the beginning of an epidemic. <br><br> Among the forty-eight thousand patients treated in that time period, a year shy of three-quarters of a century, a total of 172 had been diagnosed with diabetes. These patients represented only 0.3 percent of all cases at Mass General, but Joslin and Fitz detected a clear trend in the admissions: the number of patients with diabetes and the percentage of patients with diabetes had both been increasing steadily. As many diabetics were admitted to Mass General in the thirteen years after 1885 as in the sixty-one years prior. Joslin and Fitz considered several explanations, but they rejected the possibility that the disease itself was becoming more common. Instead, they attributed the increase in diabetic patients to a &#x201c;wholesome tendency of diabetics to place themselves under careful medical supervision.&#x201d; It wasn&#x2019;t that more Bosto- nians were succumbing to diabetes year to year, they said, but that a greater proportion of those who did were taking themselves off to the hospital for treatment. <br><br> By January 1921, when Joslin published an article about his clinical experience with diabetes for The Journal of the American Medical Association, his opinion had changed considerably. He was no longer talking about the wholesome tendencies of diabetics to&nbsp;seek medical help, but was using the word &#x201c;epidemic&#x201d; to describe what he was witnessing. &#x201c;On the broad street of a certain peaceful New England village there once stood three houses side by side,&#x201d; he wrote, apparently talking about his hometown of Oxford, Massachusetts. &#x201c;Into these three houses moved in succession four women and three men&#x2014;heads of families&#x2014;and of this number all but one subsequently succumbed to diabetes.&#x201d;&nbsp; <br><br>Joslin suggested that had these deaths been caused by an infec- tious disease&#x2014;scarlet fever, perhaps, or typhoid, or tuberculosis&#x2014; the local and state health departments would have mobilized investigative teams to establish the vectors of the disease and prevent further spread. &#x201c;Consider the measures,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;that would have been adopted to discover the source of the outbreak and to prevent a recurrence.&#x201d; Because diabetes was a chronic dis- ease, not an infectious one, and because the deaths occurred over years and not in the span of a few weeks or months, they passed unnoticed. &#x201c;Even the insurance companies,&#x201d; Joslin wrote, &#x201c;failed to grasp their significance.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>*<br>We&#x2019;ve grown accustomed, if not inured, to reading about the ongoing epidemic of obesity. Fifty years ago, one in eight American adults was obese; today the number is greater than one in three. The World Health Organization reports that obesity rates have doubled worldwide since 1980; in 2014, more than half a billion adults on the planet were obese, and more than forty million children under the age of ve were overweight or obese. Without doubt we&#x2019;ve been getting fatter, a trend that can be traced back in the United States to the nineteenth century, but the epidemic of diabetes is a more intriguing, more telling phenomenon. <br><br> Diabetes was not a new diagnosis at the tail end of the nine- teenth century when Joslin did his rst accounting, rare as the disease might have been then. As far back as the sixth century b.c., Sushruta, a Hindu physician, had described the characteristic&nbsp;sweet urine of diabetes mellitus, and noted that it was most common in the overweight and the gluttonous. By the rst century a.d., the disease may have already been known as &#x201c;diabetes&#x201d;&#x2014;a Greek term meaning &#x201c;siphon&#x201d; or &#x201c; owing through&#x201d;&#x2014;when Aretaeus of Cappodocia described its ultimate course if allowed to proceed untreated: &#x201c;The patient does not survive long when it is completely established, for the marasmus [emaciation] produced is rapid, and death speedy. Life too is odious and painful, the thirst is ungov- ernable, and the copious potations are more than equaled by the profuse urinary discharge. . . . If he stop for a very brief period, and leave off drinking, the mouth becomes parched, the body dry; the bowels seem on re, he is wretched and uneasy, and soon dies, tormented with burning thirst.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>Through the mid-nineteenth century, diabetes remained a rare af iction, to be discussed in medical texts and journal articles but rarely seen by physicians in their practices. As late as 1797, the British army surgeon John Rollo could publish &#x201c;An Account of Two Cases of the Diabetes Mellitus,&#x201d; a seminal paper in the history of the disease, and report that he had seen these cases nineteen years apart despite, as Rollo wrote, spending the intervening years &#x201c;observ[ing] an extensive range of disease in America, the West Indies, and in England.&#x201d; If the mortality records from Philadelphia in the early nineteenth century are any indication, the city&#x2019;s resi- dents were as likely to die from diabetes, or at least to have diabetes attributed as the cause of their death, as they were to be murdered or to die from anthrax, hysteria, starvation, or lethargy.<br><br> In 1890, Robert Saundby, a former president of the Edinburgh Royal Medical Society, presented a series of lectures on diabetes to the Royal College of Physicians in London in which he estimated&nbsp; <br>that less than one in every fty thousand died from the disease. Diabetes, said Saundby, is &#x201c;one of those rarer diseases&#x201d; that can only be studied by physicians who live in &#x201c;great cent[er]s of popula- tion and have the extensive practice of a large hospital from which to draw their cases.&#x201d; Saundby did note, though, that the mortality rate from diabetes was rising throughout England, in Paris, and even in New York. (At the same time, one Los Angeles physician, according to Saundby, reported &#x201c;in seven years&#x2019; practice he had not met with a single case.&#x201d;) &#x201c;The truth,&#x201d; Saundby said, &#x201c;is that diabe- tes is getting to be a common disease in certain classes, especially the wealthier commercial classes.&#x201d; <br><br>William Osler, the legendary Canadian physician often described as the &#x201c;father of modern medicine,&#x201d; also documented both the rarity and the rising tide of diabetes in the numerous editions of his seminal textbook, <i>The Principles and Practice of Medicine</i>. Osler joined the staff at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Bal- timore when the institution opened in 1889. In the first edition of his textbook, published three years later, Osler reported that, of the thirty- ve thousand patients under treatment at the hospital since its inception, only ten had been diagnosed with diabetes. In the next eight years, 156 cases were diagnosed. Mortality statistics, wrote Osler, suggested an exponential increase in those reportedly dying from the disease&#x2014;nearly doubling between 1870 and 1890 and then more than doubling again by 1900. <br><br> By the late 1920s, Joslin&#x2019;s epidemic of diabetes had become the subject of newspaper and magazine articles, while researchers in the United States and Europe were working to quantify accurately the prevalence of the disease, in a way that might allow meaningful comparisons to be drawn from year to year and decade to decade. In Copenhagen, for instance, the number of diabetics treated in the city&#x2019;s hospitals increased from ten in 1890 to 608 in 1924&#x2014;a sixty-fold increase. When the New York City health commissioner Haven Emerson and his colleague Louise Larimore published an&nbsp; <br>analysis of diabetes mortality statistics in 1924, they reported a 400 percent increase in some American cities since 1900&#x2014;almost 1,500 percent since the Civil War. <br><br> Despite all this, the disease remained a relatively rare one. When Joslin, working with Louis Dublin and Herbert Marks, both statis- ticians with the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, examined the existing evidence in 1934, he again concluded that diabetes was rapidly becoming a common disease, but only by the stan- dards of the day. He conservatively estimated&#x2014;based on what he considered careful studies done in New York, Massachusetts, and elsewhere&#x2014;that only two to three Americans in every thousand had diabetes.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h2>The Chronicle of the Lodz Ghetto, 1941-1944</h2><p>A firsthand record of life in the Lodz ghetto from 1941 to its 1944 liquidation provides a devastating look at the Jewish community and the impact of the Holocaust</p><p>Text: English, Polish (translation)</p><h2>John Carter of Mars (The Martian Tales No. 11)</h2><p>Book One of the <em>John Carter of Mars</em> collections, this edition contains the original text from the first, second, and third of Edgar Rice Burrough's world-famous novels.

I was then a child of but five years, yet I will remember the tall, dark, smooth-faced, athletic man whom I called Uncle Jack. <br> <br>He seemed always to be laughing; and he entered into the sports of the children with the same hearty good fellowship he displayed toward those pastimes in which the men and women of his own age indulged; or he would sit for an hour at a time entertaining my old grandmother with stories of his strange, wild life in all parts of the world. We all loved him, and our slaves fairly worshipped the ground he trod. <br> <br>He was a splendid specimen of manhood, standing a good two inches over six feet, broad of shoulder and narrow of hip, with the carriage of the trained fighting man. His features were regular and clear cut, his hair black and closely cropped, while his eyes were of a steel gray, reflecting a strong and loyal character, filled with fire and initiative. His manners were perfect, and his courtliness was that of a typical southern gentleman of the highest type. <br> <br>His horsemanship, especially after hounds, was a marvel and delight even in that country of magnificent horsemen. I have often heard my father caution him against his wild recklessness but he would only laugh, and say that the tumble that killed him would be from the back of a horse yet unfoaled. <br> <br>When the war broke out he left us, nor did I see him again for some fifteen or sixteen years. When he returned it was without warning, and I was much surprised to note that he had not aged apparently a moment, nor had he changed in any other outward way. He was, when others were with him, the same genial, happy fellow we had known of old, but when he thought himself alone I have seen him sit for hours gazing off into space, his face set in a look of wistful longing and hopeless misery; and at night he would sit thus looking up into the heavens, at what I did not know until I read his manuscript years afterwards. <br> <br>He told us that he had been prospecting and mining in Arizona part of the time since the war; and that he had been very successful was evidenced by the unlimited amount of money with which he was supplied. As to the details of his life during these years he was very reticent, in fact he would not talk of them at all. <br> <br>He remained with us for about a year and then went to New York, where he purchased a little place on the Hudson, where I visited him once a year on the occasions of my trips to the New York market&#x2014;my father and I owning and operating a string of general stores throughout Virginia at that time. Captain Carter had a small but beautiful cottage, situated on a bluff overlooking the river, and during one of my last visits, in the winter of 1885, I observed he was much occupied in writing, I presume now, upon this manuscript. <br> <br>He told me at this time that if anything should happen to him he wished me to take charge of his estate, and he gave me a key to a compartment in the safe which stood in his study, telling me I would find his will there and some personal instructions which he had me pledge myself to carry out with absolute fidelity. <br> <br>After I had retired for the night I have seen him from my window standing in the moonlight on the brink of the bluff overlooking the Hudson with his arms stretched out to the heavens as though in appeal. I thought at the time that he was praying, although I never had understood that he was in the strict sense of the term a religious man. <br> <br>Several months after I had returned home from my last visit, the first of March, 1886, I think, I received a telegram from him asking me to come to him at once. I had always been his favorite among the younger generation of Carters and so I hastened to comply with his demand. <br> <br>I arrived at the little station, about a mile from his grounds, on the morning of March 4, 1886, and when I asked the livery man to drive me out to Captain Carter&#x2019;s he replied that if I was a friend of the Captain&#x2019;s he had some very bad news for me; the Captain had been found dead shortly after daylight that very morning by the watchman attached to an adjoining property. <br> <br>For some reason this news did not surprise me, but I hurried out to his place as quickly as possible, so that I could take charge of the body and of his affairs. <br> <br>I found the watchman who had discovered him, together with the local police chief and several townspeople, assembled in his little study. The watchman related the few details connected with the finding of the body, which he said had been still warm when he came upon it. It lay, he said, stretched full length in the snow with the arms outstretched above the head toward the edge of the bluff, and when he showed me the spot it flashed upon me that it was the identical one where I had seen him on those other nights, with his arms raised in supplication to the skies. <br> <br>There were no marks of violence on the body, and with the aid of a local physician the coroner&#x2019;s jury quickly reached a decision of death from heart failure. Left alone in the study, I opened the safe and withdrew the contents of the drawer in which he had told me I would find my instructions. They were in part peculiar indeed, but I have followed them to each last detail as faithfully as I was able. <br> <br>He directed that I remove his body to Virginia without embalming, and that he be laid in an open coffin within a tomb which he previously had had constructed and which, as I later learned, was well ventilated. The instructions impressed upon me that I must personally see that this was carried out just as he directed, even in secrecy if necessary. <br> <br>His property was left in such a way that I was to receive the entire income for twenty-five years, when the principal was to become mine. His further instructions related to this manuscript which I was to retain sealed and unread, just as I found it, for eleven years; nor was I to divulge its contents until twenty-one years after his death. <br> <br>A strange feature about the tomb, where his body still lies, is that the massive door is equipped with a single, huge gold-plated spring lock which can be opened <i>only from the inside</i>. <br> <br>Yours very sincerely, <br> <br>Edgar Rice Burroughs <br> <br>� 2012 Simon &amp; Schuster</p><h2>Scrap-Basket Beauties: Quilting with Scraps, Strips, and Jelly Rolls</h2><p><p>Make stunning quilts from simple strips!

As an ethological study, this runs out of gas about a third of the way through. Poole's particular research niche is musth (a period of heightened sexual and aggressive behavior in male elephants), with its dribbling green penises and suppurating temporal glands. Outside a technical paper, such an arcane topic can only have appeal if situated within a broader look at elephant behavior, ... la Dian Fossey and Jane Goodall and their primates. But the big picture never forms, nor do Poole's elephants emerge as fellow creatures to whom readers might relate on some level; these elephants are raw data, forever gray (rendering suspect Poole's claim to be able to ``describe the meaning of each interaction, posture and vocalization''). Nor does Poole's tedious writing style help: ``In other words in order to be self-aware or have a sense of self, a being must possess conscious thinking''; bad enough, but then the next sentence further clarifies ``self-awareness'' as ``being aware of one's own thoughts and feelings.'' As a memoirist, Poole is exasperatingly coy. Lover Paul appears (we learn he's a Harvard man), then disappears; lover Melomyiet appears (he who ``had what so many of us have lost''), then disappears with her Land Rover; she gets raped in the Ngong Hills but treats the abomination as a biteless atmospheric; she has a child, though whether via artificial insemination, a friend, or a quickie--whoa, she ain't tellin'. Poole isn't poet enough to make the obliqueness evocative; it's just confusing. Poole's African experiences would make an adventurous book. What she needs is a biographer. (b&amp;w photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Poole is an animal behaviorist who has devoted her life to the study of the African elephant in spite of adversity and tragedy. An American raised in Kenya, Poole is versed in several cultures: American, Masai, and elephant. Her Americanism is obvious in her independence and ambition; the Masai taught her how to live in the bush; and the elephants convinced her of their great intelligence. Her intensive involvement with these majestic creatures revealed that they are self-aware, startlingly empathic beings. Poole describes her pioneering work in establishing that, like their Asian cousins, African male elephants experience musth, and that elephants communicate in low-level vibrations that humans cannot hear. Those discoveries are fascinating, and Poole's accounts of her adventures with the elephants are spellbinding; but there's a dark side to this story--the hard truth about the barbarity of poaching, the cruel, sexist politics of science, and the very real danger of being a woman alone in this land of hunters. Poole's profound commitment to the endangered elephants of Kenya has cost her dearly in personal terms, but her contributions to science are legion. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Looking at Indian Art of the Northwest Coast</h2><p><p>Bold, inventive indigenous art of the Northwest Coast is distinguished by its sophistication and complexity.

In my navy blue skirt suit I looked like a dozen other mothers who had had to come straight from work to the dance recital. My hair was a little curly and a little too black for all the blond mothers, but no one gave me a second glance. The one saving grace as I threaded my way through the crowd of parents, aunts, uncles, grandparents, and siblings was that I wasn&#x2019;t one of the parents. I was just here as moral support and last-minute costume rescuer. It was just Monica Vespucci&#x2019;s style to leave part of her son&#x2019;s costume at her house and need an emergency save. Micah and I had been running late with client meetings so we got to ride to the rescue, and now since the vast majority of the performers were female I was the only one safe to go backstage without scandalizing the mothers. What did little girls who only had male relatives do at things like this? My dad would have been at a loss. </p><p>A little girl and her mother damn near knocked me down the stairs in their rush to get up past me. The little girl was knocked into me so that my suit jacket pushed back and she was staring at my holstered gun and U.S. Marshal badge. The child&#x2019;s eyes went big as she met my eyes. The mother never noticed, dragging the silent child up the stairs. I let them get ahead of me, the little girl&#x2019;s huge, dark eyes following me until the crowd hid her from sight. She couldn&#x2019;t have been more than five. I wondered if she&#x2019;d even try to tell her mother she&#x2019;d seen a woman with a gun and a badge. </p><p>I started pushing my way up the stairs, keeping the hand with the clown hat in it close to my jacket so I wouldn&#x2019;t flash the gun by accident anymore. I was going to try to keep my occupation a secret from the screaming children and their frantic mothers. They didn&#x2019;t need to know that I hunted bad little vampires and wereanimals for the preternatural branch of the U.S. Marshals Service. They certainly didn&#x2019;t need to know that I raised zombies as my day job. I blended in as long as no one figured out who I was.</p><p>I got to the upper hallway and there was one lone male over the age of twelve being herded by his mother. She had an almost embarrassed look on her face, as if apologizing for not having a girl. I knew there were more men up here, because some of them were mine, but they were safely away from the estrogen-rich room of little girls. </p><p>Monica&#x2019;s son was under five, so he didn&#x2019;t count as male yet. He was just a generic child. Now if I could only find the generic child, hand his mother the hat, and flee to our seats where everyone was waiting for me, I&#x2019;d count it as a win, though knowing Monica she&#x2019;d need something else. I didn&#x2019;t like her at all. But her husband had been one of Jean-Claude&#x2019;s vampires who died sort of in the line of duty, so Jean-Claude made sure that he and others stood in for her lost husband. It was honorable, I even approved of it, but I avoided Monica when I could. She&#x2019;d betrayed me and a shared friend to some bad vampires once. She&#x2019;d apologized, and she depended on Jean-Claude&#x2019;s people for emergency babysitting and things like tonight. She&#x2019;d been bad because the old Master of the City had been bad; now that we had a good Master of the City, Jean-Claude, she was good. Sure, and the Easter Bunny is a friend of mine. </p><p>The fact that I had a key to her house in case of emergencies still bugged me, but Jean-Claude was right; someone who could go out in the daylight needed to have the key. He also knew that no matter how much I disliked Monica, I&#x2019;d do the right thing. He was right, damn it. A herd of pink, sequined little girls barreled past me. I hugged the wall and let the teachers chase them down. There were so many reasons I didn&#x2019;t have children yet. </p><p>I heard my name squealed out, in that high-pitched generic toddler voice, &#x201c;&#x2019;Nita, &#x2019;Nita!&#x201d; I had no idea why, but just lately Matthew, Monica&#x2019;s son, had taken a liking to me. </p><p>He came rushing at me in his bright multicolored clown outfit with the little balls on the front that matched the ones on the hat. His hair was a deep auburn like his mother&#x2019;s, but there was something about his threeyear-old face that made me think of his dead father. Robert hadn&#x2019;t been my favorite vampire, but he&#x2019;d been handsome and Matthew was a cute kid. He came running with his arms up and launched himself at me. He was not big for his age but it was still startling. I caught him and swept him up in my arms because to do anything else would have either knocked me flat or been churlish. </p><p>He put those little hands on my shoulders and leaned in for a kiss. I offered a cheek, but he touched my face and shook his head, very solemn. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a big boy now, &#x2019;Nita. I kiss like a big boy now.&#x201d; Cheek kisses had been fine until about two weeks ago, and now Matthew was very certain that cheek kisses were baby kisses. It made me wonder if Monica was being overly friendly with the new boyfriend in front of the kid. It was Monica; there would be a boyfriend. </p><p>I&#x2019;d told Monica about it and she thought it was cute. Matthew puckered up and planted one on my mouth, which meant he was wearing my very red lipstick. &#x201c;Now you&#x2019;ve got my lipstick on you, and that&#x2019;s more big girl than big boy,&#x201d; I said, as I looked around for some Kleenex or something to wipe his mouth with. I was also looking for his mother. Where was Monica? </p><p>&#x201c;It is big boy if it&#x2019;s your lipstick.&#x201d; </p><p>I frowned at that tiny face just inches from mine. &#x201c;What do you mean, it&#x2019;s big boy if it&#x2019;s mine?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;All the big boys kiss you, &#x2019;Nita.&#x201d; </p><p>I had a sinking feeling that maybe it wasn&#x2019;t just Monica and a boyfriend in front of Matthew that were giving him ideas. &#x201c;Where is your mother?&#x201d; I said, and began searching the room for her a little desperately.</p> <p>She finally separated herself from the mass of women and girls of various ages and came toward us beaming. It creeped me out a little that Monica seemed to think I didn&#x2019;t hold a grudge about her betraying me five years ago. I did hold a grudge and I didn&#x2019;t trust her. She seemed unaware of that. </p><p>She had Matthew&#x2019;s curly auburn hair, cut shorter and more styled, but her face was thinner, more of a sharp triangle, as if she&#x2019;d lost weight since I saw her last. Once upon a time you could have asked if she was feeling all right, but now women dieted for no reason at all. Monica was shorter than I was by a few inches, and I was five-three. She was still in her skirt suit, too, but her blouse was white, and mine was blue. </p><p>Matthew kept his arms around my neck while she used a wet wipe on his mouth. Then she put a paler shade of lip gloss on his lips, though they didn&#x2019;t seem to need any to me. She took the hat from me and put it over his curls. If he&#x2019;d been any older the outfit would have been embarrassing to any boy I&#x2019;d ever met, but at three it was actually . . . cute. I would not admit it out loud, but it was. </p><p>&#x201c;Thank you so much, Anita,&#x201d; Monica said. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe I forgot it.&#x201d; </p><p>I could, but I just smiled and kept quiet. Quiet usually worked better between Monica and me. A mass of little girls dressed in the girl version of his outfit bounced up, and he wiggled to be put down. I did so, happily. </p><p>Monica watched him run away with the others in his class with that proverbial mother&#x2019;s look: pride, love, and almost possession. I never doubted that she loved her little boy. It was one of the reasons I was nice to her. </p><p>She turned to me, still smiling. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so glad the recital is tonight so I can concentrate on the business tomorrow.&#x201d; </p><p>I nodded, and tried to make my escape. Monica was apparently a better lawyer than she was a human being, or at least Jean-Claude trusted her to do up the contracts that might, or might not, be getting signed tomorrow. I trusted Jean-Claude to be a good businessman. </p><p>&#x201c;Agreed,&#x201d; I said, and tried to slip away. </p><p>She grabbed my arm. I don&#x2019;t like to be touched by people that I&#x2019;m not close to. I stiffened under her hand, but she didn&#x2019;t seem to notice. She leaned in and whispered, &#x201c;If I was being offered a seventeen-year-old boy toy I&#x2019;d be more excited, Anita.&#x201d; </p><p>Matthew was out of sight so I let my eyes show just how happy that comment made me. Monica let go of my arm, her eyes a little wide, face surprised. &#x201c;Oh, come on, Anita, what woman wouldn&#x2019;t be flattered?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;First, I haven&#x2019;t agreed to letting him stay in St. Louis when they bring him in from Vegas tomorrow. Second, don&#x2019;t ever call him a boy toy again.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Touchy,&#x201d; she said, and then her face softened and her eyes glittered with some thought that I knew I wasn&#x2019;t going to like. &#x201c;Defensive of him already, Anita. My, my, he must be better in bed than I remember at that age.&#x201d; </p><p>I leaned in and hissed in her ear. &#x201c;We were all mind-raped by one of the scariest vampires to ever exist, Monica. She used me to feed on his power as a weretiger. She used me, and him, and all the other tigers in a bid to survive even if it meant destroying all of us. You tell me, what part of that was a good thing?&#x201d; I had grabbed her arm somewhere in all that.</p> <p>She spoke low. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re hurting me.&#x201d; </p><p>I let go of her, and stepped back. She looked up at me, and I think for a moment let herself see me, really see me. She was angry, and for just a moment I knew that she didn&#x2019;t like me any more than I liked her, not really. Then I watched a different look cross her face, one that most men would have thought was a good look, but a woman knows when another woman is about to drive the blade home. </p><p>&#x201c;Funny how it&#x2019;s never your fault when you have to have sex with all these men, Anita,&#x201d; and with that she walked away. She walked away with the proverbial knife stuck deep and hard right through my heart. Nothing cuts deeper than when another person says exactly what you&#x2019;re afraid to say out loud. Hell, Matthew had said it, too, in his way. All the big boys kiss you, &#x2019;Nita.</p> <p>I fled the laughing costumed children and Monica&#x2019;s knowing eyes. I waved at Matthew as he called my name, all lined up with the little girls in his class. I wanted to be in my seat so I could see him; he&#x2019;d go on second. Yeah, that was it, I hurried to my seat to make sure I&#x2019;d see his performance, but I knew that wasn&#x2019;t the truth. I ran toward my seat and the men waiting for me, because part of me believed that Monica was right and all my words were just a case of the lady protesting too much. </p></p><h2>Consuelo and Alva Vanderbilt: The Story of a Daughter and a Mother in the Gilded Age</h2><p><p>On a November day in 1895, crowds of curious sightseers gathered outside St. Thomas Church on Fifth Avenue in New York, intent on spotting a small dapper bridegroom whom they knew to be a great English aristocrat awaiting his bride-to-be. When she arrived, twenty minutes late, anyone who caught a glimpse beneath Consuelo Vanderbilt's veil would have seen that her face was swollen from crying.</p><p>When Consuelo's grandfather died, he was the richest man in America. Her father soon started to spend the family fortune, enthusiastically supported by Consuelo's mother, Alva, who was determined to take the family to the top of New York society. She was adamant that her daughter should make a grand marriage, and the underfunded Duke of Marlborough was just the thing. It didn't matter that Consuelo loved someone else; as Alva once told her, "I don't ask you to think, I do the thinking, you do as you're told."</p><p>However, the story of Consuelo and Alva is not simply one of the emptiness of wealth, of the glamour of the Gilded Age, and of enterprising social ambition. This is a fascinating account of how two women struggled to break free from the deeply materialistic world into which they were born, taking up the fight for female equality. Consuelo threw herself into good works; Winston Churchill encouraged her to make her first public speech, and her social and political campaigns proved an antidote to loneliness. Alva embraced the militant suffragette movement in America, helping to bring the fight for the vote to its triumphant conclusion and campaigning vehemently for women's rights until she died. In this brilliant and engrossing book, Amanda Mackenzie Stuart suggests that behind the most famous transatlantic marriage of all lies an extraordinary tale of the quest for female power.</p></p><p><p>Amanda Mackenzie Stuart is the author of Consuelo and Alva Vanderbilt: The Story of a Daughter and a Mother in the Gilded Age. She lives in Oxford, England. </p>Alva Erskine Smith came from a family with more pretensions than money. She saved her family from barely genteel poverty by marrying William K. Vanderbilt, grandson of the richest man in America. And she saved the Vanderbilts, who had not yet transformed their money into social standing, by maneuvering her way to the pinnacle of the Gilded Age New York elite. Her daughter, Consuelo, was both instrument and victim of her most brilliant social coup, in which she converted wealth and beauty into an aristocratic title by forcing Consuelo to marry the fatuous and ill-tempered Duke of Marlborough. The duke desperately needed Vanderbilt money to refurbish his vast ancestral home at Blenheim, a money pit with its 150 rooms and only one bath. <p>Amanda Mackenzie Stuart tells the stories of Alva and Consuelo in an intertwined narrative, an approach that adds depth to our understanding of both their lives. Mother and daughter strongly influenced each other, although not in ways that either found comfortable. Alva was a strong-minded woman increasingly frustrated by her role as wife of a rich man with little of meaning to do; her time was consumed with planning and attending parties and balls, ordering clothes and wearing them, building and decorating mansions. According to Stuart, she believed that she was giving her daughter a chance to play a more satisfying role as the Duchess of Marlborough. Consuelo resisted the match, but Alva took to her bed until she gave way and agreed to the near-royal wedding that Alva had already trumpeted to the newspapers. </p><p> Consuelo's marriage made her miserable -- the duke criticized every initiative she took, and his mother despised her -- but she established herself as a sought-after presence in British high society, in spite of its prejudice against American heiresses. Winston Churchill was a particular friend, as were other luminaries of the time. She speedily produced two male heirs, but she and the duke separated in 1906, 11 years after they married. More liberal than her husband, as Edwardian society began to disintegrate and reform into something more modern, she flourished while the duke languished. Philanthropy gave Consuelo an effective public role, as her mother had hoped in arranging her marriage. After the separation, Consuelo became a conservative feminist, an able organizer and administrator of many projects for the less fortunate and a successful public speaker. And in 1921, Consuelo remarried for love, to Jacques Balsan, a French pioneer of aviation. </p><p>Alva also sought love the second time around, divorcing William K. Vanderbilt to marry Oliver Belmont, a wealthy "gentleman of leisure." After Belmont's death, she reemerged into public life as a militant feminist -- far more radical than her daughter but with the same arrogance she had exhibited as a mother and socialite. She played an important role in the National Woman's Party, supporting Alice Paul and the suffragists who chained themselves to the White House fence during World War I. Alva constantly tried to recruit Consuelo for the more militant wing of the suffrage movement, but Consuelo declined to be swayed. Her mother could no longer rule her, although she used Consuelo's fame to her own advantage in planning social events. Readers who are not familiar with the personalities and struggles of the suffrage movements in the United States and England will not learn much here. Stuart's focus is on the two women and not the cause in which both, in quite different ways, were involved.</p><p>Stuart has skillfully integrated a great deal of research, including interviews with family members and an extensive bibliography, into her twined biographies, and she gives a rich sense of both women. She is less successful with the other characters. Several of the recurring and important people remain simply names and events, with no life, no color, of their own. But Stuart is excellent at describing the almost monstrous social occasions, such as the Prince of Wales's 1896 visit to Blenheim: "There were over a hundred people in the house while the shooting party lasted. . . . The women spent most of their time dawdling, chatting and changing. . . . The men were rather more active for they had come to shoot. . . . On Tuesday morning the Duke escorted his guests to part of the estate known as High Park where eight guns shot over two thousand rabbits. On Wednesday the party went to North Leigh where eighty beaters were on hand in light brown Holland smocks and red caps to assist with the bagging of over a thousand birds." </p><p>With Stuart's precise descriptions of the endless balls and fetes and the gowns and jewels worn by each woman, reading the book at times feels like consuming six courses of pastry. The latter half, when Alva and Consuelo begin to be politically active, is far livelier. Mother and daughter were both activists and snobs (Alva abused her servants, Consuelo was anti-Semitic), do-gooders and clothes-horses, denizens of Vogue and the political papers. Alva certainly deserves to be returned to her place in the history of feminism and the struggle for the vote in the United States, however controversial and uncomfortable her personality made her. But as Stuart ably demonstrates, they both heroically met the challenges faced by talented and energetic women at the turn of the last century. </p><p>Reviewed by Marge Piercy <br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

His publications include Warrior: The First Ironclad and The Crimean War: British Grand Strategy Against Russia, 1853-60.<br>Every library requires a basic source on sailing ship warfare, a need solidly met by Lambert's profusely illustrated survey of the two centuries of naval dominance, ending about 1850, by the triple-masted, multidecked, heavily gunned ship of the line. Lambert, a naval historian in Britain, efficiently economizes his text, wasting few words to narrate the geopolitical framework for the expensive construction and maintenance of fleets, of strategies for their operation, and, ultimately, of their tactics in battle. Making the important point that few battles between the days of de Ruyter and those of Nelson were decisive, Lambert impresses upon the reader the appreciation strategists reached that naval warfare was characterized by attrition, rarely by the cataclysmic victory a la Trafalgar. And so most naval operations were those of convoy, pursuit, blockade--things rather less exciting than the climax of broadsides in battle, the moment depicted in most of the dozens of paintings reproduced in Lambert's book. Twenty maps and perspective schematics of key battles support this able introduction to the warfare of wooden ships. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Tour.</p><p><i>Here Is Grace Mirabella's Elegant Yet Outspoken Memoir Of Her Life At The Top Of The Fashion World And The Height Of New York Society</i> : <i>Her Thirty-Eight Years At Vogue (Seventeen As Editor-in-Chief</i>, <i>And Her Current Position As The Driving Force Behind The Great Success Of Mirabella</i>.<p> In this forthright, anecdotal memoir, Grace Mirabella describes her journey through the exciting and treacherous worlds of fashion, glossy magazines, and high society. Born in New Jersey, she worked her way from retail sales at Macy's and Saks to the top of the <i>Vogue</i> masthead. Along the way, she came to know and work with "the Beautiful People" who set the tone and look of the time. Apprenticed to the outrageous Diana Vreeland, she put up with the temper tantrums and fits of pique and genius of some of the most sought-after creative minds of the era. She also saw everything she thought was wrong with fashion magazines: their distance from reality, their disinterest in real women and their lives, their disregard for money.</p><p> When she succeeded Vreeland as <i>Vogue's</i> editor in chief in the 1970s, Mirabella redesigned and redefined the magazine. By the end of her seventeen-year term with the magazine, its readership had tripled. But in the 1980s, Grace was very publicly fired. Displaying the strength, grace, and sheer style for which she has come to be known, within months, she had taken the helm of a brand-new magazine, the nationally award-winning <i>Mirabella</i>.</p><p><i>In And Out Of Vogue</i> is a fascinating examination of the cultural and political changes that led to Mirabella's dismissal, and a lively inside look at the gossipy, Machiavellian fashion and magazine worlds. Most important, it is the intimate, all-American success story of a woman who has always been just a little ahead of her time: A woman who, as the creator and editor of a magazine of unparalleled intelligence, has made it her life's work to put style in print.</p>Grace Mirabella, editor-in-chief of <i>Vogue</i> magazine for 17 years and founder of <i>Mirabella</i> magazine, tells (with the help of a coauthor) of her 38 years working in the fashion industry. Born to immigrant Italians and raised in Newark, New Jersey, Mirabella attended one of the finest women's colleges, ran with a society crowd, and through admirable persistence worked her way to the top of <i>Vogue</i> magazine. Her tale of life at <i>Vogue</i> is repugnant yet fascinating. While neither talent nor skill was required to land a job there in the 1950s, a pedigreed bloodline or a certain "look" could land you in the editor's chair. Mirabella tells of working under a bevy of vacuous prima donnas obsessed with their own visions, who never bothered with the day-to-day administration of the magazine and as a result nearly ran it into the ground. Interesting for its portrayal of intrigue and plotting in the dog-eat-dog world of high fashion, her book also provides a great historical perspective on society, style, and fashion. Ultimately though, this book is somewhat disappointing, for she never really condemns the industry for its shallowness. <i>Kathleen Hughes</i></p><h2>The Glass Lake</h2><p>Night after night the beautiful woman walked beside the serene waters of Lough Glass. Until the day she disappeared, leaving only a boat drifting upside down on the unfathomable lake that gave the town its name. Ravishing Helen McMahon, the Dubliner with film-star looks and unfulfilled dreams, never belonged in Lough Glass, not the way her genial pharmacist-husband Martin belonged, or their spirited daughter Kit. Suddenly, she is gone and Kit is haunted by the memory of her mother, seen through a window, alone at the kitchen table, tears streaming down her face. Now Kit, too, has secrets: of the night she discovered a letter on Martin&#x2019;s pillow and burned it, unopened. The night her mother was lost. The night everything changed forever...</p><p>In the tradition of her beloved novel Circle of Friends, Irish novelist Maeve Binchey offers a wonderful old-fashioned melodrama with a contemporary cast of compelling characters. A sly, seductive, and compulsively readable book, perfect for rainy afternoons and late nights in bed.Kit MacMahon, growing up in the lakeside village of Loughshee, seems to lead a charmed life. She is the loved daughter of Martin MacMahon, the kindly local pharmacist, and Helen, his beautiful wife. She has a little brother, Emmett; a best friend, Clio, and a host of other friends.<p></p><p>But Kit worries about her mother. Helen MacMahon does not fit in with the people and the ways of Loughshee. She wanders alone by the lake night after night -- until the dark windy night when she disappears and only her overturned rowboat is found near Loughshee's shore.</p><p></p><p>Kit grows up in the small village without the mother she has loved and so staunchly defended, determined to carry out her mother's last wishes that she should make something of her life. Though she moves to the city, Kit is constantly drawn back to Loughshee and the people who live there -- Clio Kelly and their love/hate relationship; Clio's father Dr. Kelly, whose sister-in-law Maura has her eyes on Kit's father; Philip O'Brien, who has loved Kit since childhood; and roguish Stevie Sullivan, who runs the garage and rules the affections of every woman for miles around.</p><p></p><p><i>The Glass Lake</i> tells the story of how Kit MacMahon carries out her mother's last wishes; a story of how faith and courage can be rewarded. It is Maeve Binchy at her spellbinding best, creating a novel of such warmth and humor that the reader will never want it to end.</p></p><h2>Father, The Family Protector</h2><p>In this companion work to his book Compass: A Handbook on Parent Leadership, James B. Stenson explores how Fathers exercise their powerful and particularly masculine contribution to family life. His research comes from more than twenty years of working with families from two highly successful independent secondary schools for boys that he helped establish, The Heights School in Washington D.C., and Northridge Preparatory School in Chicago. As headmaster, he made it his business to know hundreds of families intimately - studying their family lives, watching their children grow into maturity, very often successfully, but sometimes not. Through countless conversations with Fathers and mothers, he tried to account for the differences, looking for patterns of family life among those parents who triumphed with their children. What did these succesful men and women have in common? What did they manage to do right? Most important: what could other parents learn from the! ir experience? <p>This wisdom of Fatherhood is what this book is all about. It explains the main obstacles in today's society that undercut a Father's teaching role, and tells men what they could do to overcome them. Then within this framework, James Stenson spells out how successful Fathers deal with their children in the more crucial areas: family rules, discipline, schooling, sports, recreation, the media, and ongoing teamwork with one's wife. In short, this book provides the guidance that will help any Father to carry out a serious responsibility - that of protector of his family.</p></p><p></p><h2>My Sweet Audrina</h2><p>A stand-alone mystery thriller from the bestselling author of Flowers in the Attic. MY SWEET AUDRINA The house in the wood was picturesque and charming. The family who lived there were happy and affluent. So what was the secret of the room -- empty of everything but the rocking chair? Audrina wanted to be as good as her sister. Audrina knew her parents could not love her as they loved her sister. Her sister was perfect, much loved -- and dead. But how did she die? Who was Audrina and who did she have to become? What was the secret that everyone knew? Everyone except sweet Audrina! The haunting story of love and deceit, innocence and betrayal, and terrible family secrets.</p><p>Virginia Andrews lived in Norfolk, Virginia, studied art and worked as a fashion illustrator, commercial artist and portrait painter. Flowers in the Attic, based on a true story, was her first novel. It became an immediate bestseller on both sides of the Atlantic when it was first published in 1979. Virginia Andrews died in 1986, leaving a considerable amount of unpublished work.<b>Part 1: Whitefern</b><br><br>There was something strange about the house where I grew up. There were shadows in the corners and whispers on the stairs and time was as irrelevant as honesty. Though how I knew that I couldn't say.<br><br>There was a war going on in our house, a silent war that sounded no guns, and the bodies that fell were only wishes that died and the bullets were only words and the blood that spilled was always called pride.<br><br>Though I'd never been to school -- and I was seven years old and it was high time I was in school -- it seemed I knew all about the Civil War. Around me the Civil War was still being waged, and though the future might stretch ahead for billions of years, it was still the war we'd never forget, for our pride had been injured, and our passions were lingering on. We'd lost the battle better won by the opposite side. Maybe that's why it still kept hurting.<br><br>Momma and my aunt Ellsbeth always said that men liked violent discussions about wars better than any other topic, but if there were other wars of any importance at all, they were never discussed in our house. Papa would read any book, see any movie, cut out any magazine photo that represented that war between brothers, even though his ancestors had fought against my maternal ones. He was Yankee born, but a Southerner by preference. At the dinner table he'd recount the plots of the long novels he read about General Robert E. Lee and give grisly accounts of all the bloody battles. And if most of what he read charmed me, it did not charm either my aunt, who preferred the television, or my mother, who preferred to read her own books, claiming Papa left out the best parts, which weren't fit for young ears to hear.<br><br>That meant my ears, and my cousin Vera's ears. Though most of the world believed Vera to be my sister, I knew she was my unmarried aunt's illegitimate daughter -- and that we had to shield her from the scorn of society by pretending she was my legitimate older sister. I did have a legitimate older sister, too, but she had died before I was born. Her name was also Audrina, and even though she had been dead a long time, still she lingered on. My papa never forgot the first and best Audrina, and still hoped that someday I would be as special as she was.<br><br>My cousin Vera liked people to think she was my sister. I didn't know her true age, for she refused to tell me that. Nobody in our house ever revealed their ages. Only my age was talked about all the time. It was Vera's boast that she could be any age she wanted to be -- ten, twelve, fifteen, and even twenty. With a few elegant and sophisticated postures, truly she did change her manner and expression. She could look very mature -- or very childlike -- depending on her mood. She liked to ridicule me because I was so uncertain about time. Often Vera told me I'd hatched full blown from a giant ostrich egg at the age of seven. She always said that I had inherited that bird's famous habit of sticking its head in the sand and pretending nothing in the world was wrong. She didn't know about my dreams and the ugliness they gave me.<br><br>From the very beginning, I knew Vera was my enemy even when she pretended to be my friend. Though I wanted her for my friend in the worst way, I knew she hated me. She was jealous because I was an Audrina and she wasn't. Oh, how I wanted Vera to like and admire me, as sometimes I really liked and admired her. I envied her, too, because she was normal and didn't have to try to be like someone who was dead. No one seemed to care if Vera wasn't special. No one except Vera. Vera was fond of telling me that I wasn't really special, either, I was merely strange. To tell the truth, I thought there was something strange about me, too. I seemed to be unable to recall anything about my early childhood. I couldn't remember anything about the past -- what I had done the week or even the day before. I didn't know how I had learned the things I knew, or why I seemed to know some things I shouldn't.<br><br>The many clocks scattered throughout our giant house confused me even more. The grandfather clocks in the halls chimed out different hours; the cuckoos in their wooden Swiss clocks popped in and out of small ornate doors, each contradicting all the others; the fancy French clock in my parents' bedroom had stopped long ago at midnight or noon, and a Chinese clock ran backwards. To my great distress, though I searched everywhere, there were no calendars in our house, not even old ones. And the newspapers never came on the day they were due. Our only magazines were old ones, stacked in closets, hidden in the attic. Nobody threw anything away in our house. It was kept, saved for our descendents, so they could sell it one day and make a fortune.<br><br>Much of my insecurity had to do with the first Audrina, who had died exactly nine years before I was born. She had died mysteriously in the woods after cruel and heartless boys had spoiled her in some indescribable way, and because of her, I was never supposed to enter the woods, even to go to school. And the woods were all around us, almost smothering us. They embraced us on three sides, the River Lyle on the fourth. To go anywhere we had to travel through the woods.<br><br>Everywhere in our home photographs of the First and Best Audrina were scattered. On Papa's desk, there were three framed portraits of her, at age one, two and three. There was not one single baby picture of me, not one, and that hurt. The First Audrina had been a beautiful little girl, and when I looked at her photographs, I felt oddly haunted, wanting to be her so badly I ached inside. I wanted to be her so I'd feel as loved, as special as everyone said she had been; and then again, contrarily, I wanted more than anything to be myself, and on my own merits gain the love I felt denied me.<br><br>Oh, the tales Papa could tell me about the wonders of his first daughter, and everyone he told made me know I was not the Best Audrina, not the perfect and special one -- only the second and the inferior one.<br><br>My parents kept the first Audrina's bedroom like a shrine for a dead princess. It was left exactly as it had been on the day she met her fate, which was never explained in detail to me. That room was so full of toys it seemed more a playroom than a bedroom. Momma herself cleaned that room, and she hated housework. Just to see <i>her</i> room made me realize nothing had been too good for <i>her,</i> while my bedroom lacked toy shelves, and her vast array of playthings. I felt cheated, cheated of a real childhood. Audrina the First and Best had stolen my youth, and everyone talked so much about her that I couldn't remember anything about me. I believed it was because of her that my memory was so full of holes.<br><br>Papa would try to fill those holes by putting me in her rocking chair and making me rock and sing until I became "the empty pitcher that would fill with everything."<br><br>He wanted me to fill with her memories and capture her special powers since she was dead and didn't need them anymore.<br><br>And as if one ghost weren't enough, we had a second who came every Tuesday at four. "Teatime," we called Aunt Mercy Marie's day. There she'd sit on the piano, in her black and white photograph in a silver frame, her fat face beaming a vacuous smile, her pale blue eyes staring out as if she could see us, when she couldn't. She was dead, and yet undead, just like my dead sister.<br><br>My aunt and my mother would speak for Aunt Mercy Marie, and through her they would let loose all the venom they held back and saved for "teatimes." Strangely enough, my cousin Vera enjoyed these Tuesday teatimes so much she'd find any reason to play hookey from school, just to be there and hear all the ugly things my mother and her half sister could say to one another. They were Whitefern sisters, and once upon a far ago time, that had meant something wonderful. Now it meant something sad, but they would never tell me exactly what.<br><br>Long ago the Whitefern family had been the most notable family in our Tidewater section of Virginia, giving the country senators and vice presidents. But we'd fallen out of favor not just with the villagers, but also with everyone, and we were no longer honored, or even respected.<br><br>Our house was far from the nearest city of any size.<br><br>Whitefern Village was fifteen miles down a lonely country road, but we seldom went there. It was as if long ago some secret war had been declared, and we in our castle (as Papa liked to call our home) were hated by the "serfs" in the lowlands. If anyplace in our vicinity could be called "highlands" it was the slight hill on which Whitefern sat.<br><br>Papa had to drive thirty miles to and from his stockbrokerage office. All the friends we had lived in the city. Our nearest neighbors were twelve miles away as a car drove, five as a crow flew. Papa drove our only car to work, leaving all of us without transportation. So often my aunt Ellsbeth would bemoan the day she'd sold her small car to buy the TV set.<br><br>My aunt, who'd never been married, loved her portable television set with a twelve-inch screen. She seldom allowed me to watch, though her daughter, Vera, could watch as much as she liked when she was home from school. That was another thing I couldn't understand: why Vera was allowed to go to school when I couldn't go. School was dangerous for me, but not for Vera.<br><br>Naturally I presumed there had to be something terribly wrong with me. My parents had to hide me away to keep me safe, if not from outsiders, then from myself. That was the scariest thought of all.<br><br>At the age of seven, while other children boarded yellow buses and rode off giggling and having fun, I sat down at the kitchen table and was taught how to read, write, add and subtract by my mother, who played the piano beautifully but was not good at teaching anything but how to play the piano. Fortunately, or maybe not, my aunt Ellsbeth was there to help. She had once been a gradeschool teacher with ready slaps to deliver any boy who dared to call her a nasty name. Just one slap too many, and the parents had seen that my aunt was fired. Though she tried for many a year to find another teaching position, the word was out. My aunt had a ferocious temper and a ready hand.<br><br>Aunt Ellsbeth, like her daughter, Vera, also had ready comments to criticize our way of living. According to my aunt we were all as "antediluvian" as the house in which we lived. "Out of sync with the rest of the world," she'd say.<br><br>In my dreams of home, Whitefern loomed up high and white against a dark and stormy sky, frightening to behold. It threatened in the night, but in the day it welcomed me with open arms. I had a habit of sitting outside on the lawn and admiring the grandness of Whitefern. It was a gingerbread Victorian house of many frills, with its white paint peeling, its dark blinds loose and crooked. It had three stories, with an attic and a basement toward the back half of the house where the spacious lawn inclined toward the River Lyle. As I stared at that house, I thought I had much in common with it. We were both antediluvian and out of sync.<br><br>Our windows were myriad, many of them beautiful stained glass. The shutters, about to fall off, were so darkly red they appeared black from a distance, like dried blood. From the outside the most marvelous thing of all were the balustrades on all the many porches, balconies and verandas, designed to look like stylized woodferns.<br><br>In the very center of the dark roof was a round cupola with a copper roof now turned green from tarnish. It formed a point that was topped by a golden ball whose gold leaf was coming off bit by bit each time it rained.<br><br>The cupola was about fourteen feet in diameter, and every single one of its many windows was made of leaded stained glass with scenes to represent the angels of life and death.<br><br>Inside and out, ferns cascaded everywhere from wicker stands. There were other plants, but the ferns seemed to steal what moisture there was in the air so soon all other plants died.<br><br>On stealthy, timid feet I played my small lonely games in the great foyer where the stained glass from the double front doors threw colorful patterns on the floor. Rapier-sharp colors sometimes, stabbing into my brain and punching holes there. I also had little rhymes Vera had taught me that I said to protect myself from the colors:<br><br><i>Step on black, live forever in a shack.<br><br>Step on green, never be clean.<br><br>Step on blue, work will never be through.<br><br>Step on yellow, hear the world bellow.<br><br>Step on red, soon be dead.</i><br><br>Just so I wouldn't have to step on any color, I stole along near the walls, keeping to the shadows, listening to the clocks ticking away the wrong times and the silly cuckoos going crazy in the night. When the wind blew hard, the shutters banged and the floors creaked, the furnace in the basement coughed, sputtered, groaned, and the wind chimes in the cupola tinkled, tinkled.<br><br>Yet in the daytime there were things so wondrously grand in our house that I felt like Alice lost in a house of jewels. Art deco lamps and <i>objets d'art</i> were scattered hither and yon. Tiffany lamps rose up to throw more colors, to pattern the walls. Crystal prisms dangled from lamp shades, from wall sconces, from chandeliers, from gaslamps, catching colors, refracting rainbows that flashed like lightning whenever sunlight managed to steal through the lace curtains.<br><br>We had a fireplace in every room. There were eight of marble, many of elegantly carved wood and none were made of brick. Brick was not elegant enough for our type of house that seemed to despise simplicity.<br><br>Our ceilings were high, and carved with elaborate designs, making frames for Biblical or romantic scenes. In the olden days people had, or so it seemed to my young eyes, either too many clothes on, or too little that wanted to stay in place. I wondered why the Biblical scenes usually had more flesh showing than the ones where people were decidedly wicked. One could hardly believe those near-naked people were sincerely trying to follow where God would lead them.<br><br>Bare bosoms of impressive proportions protruded brazenly in every room of our house but mine. George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and several other dead-eyed presidents gazed day after day at the naked lady lying on a chaise across the way as she forever dropped grapes into her gaping mouth. Naked baby boys flew about shamelessly shooting aimless arrows. But the men always modestly hid their maleness behind some strategically placed leaf or graceful flow of drapery. Women were not so apt to hide what they had, I'd often thought as I gazed at them. They looked shy, but acted bold. Aunt Ellsbeth had come up behind me once and explained bitterly that since most artists were men, it was only natural for them to delight in "exploiting" the nude female figure.<br><br>"Don't judge women by what you see in paintings and statues. Judge them only by what you yourself know about the women in your life. The day any man understands any woman will be the day the world comes to an end. Men are hateful, contrary creatures who say they want goddesses to put on pedestals. Once they have them up there, they rip off the halo, tear off the gown, slice off the wings so they can't fly and then kick the pedestal away so the woman falls at his feet and he can scream out as he kicks her, tramp! -- or worse."<br><br>To hear my aunt Ellsbeth talk one would think she'd been married a dozen or more times, and one thousand men had disappointed her. As far as I knew, only one man had.<br><br>Our furniture had many styles, all of them fancy. It seemed each chair, each table, each sofa, lamp, pillow, hassock, desk was in competition, trying to o...</p><h2>Cal: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>"Bernard MacLaverty's powerful novel is a love story as affecting and tragic as you could want."&#x2015;<em>USA Today</em></strong></p> When it was first published, Bernard MacLaverty's fiction masterpiece was hailed by Michael Gorra in the <em>New York Times Book Review</em> as "a marvel of technical perfection. . . . Cal is a most moving novel whose emotional impact is grounded in a complete avoidance of sentimentality. . . . [It] will become the <em>Passage to India of the Troubles</em>."<br><br> For Cal, a Belfast teenager who, against his will, is involved in the terrible war between Catholics and Protestants, some of the choices are devastatingly simple: he can work in the slaughterhouse that nauseates him or join the dole queue; he can brood on his past or plan a future with the beautiful, widowed Marcella for whose grief he shares more than a little responsibility.</p><p>First published in 1983, this lyrical novel, superficially straightforward but full of stories within stories, first brought Bernard MacLaverty&#39;s work to public attention. In the novel, a young Irish Republican Army operative who wants to break the cycle of violence seeks out a woman whose Ulster policeman husband he helped to murder. As their relationship grows, so do Cal&#39;s guilt and sorrow, until, in the end, he is forced to make a sacrifice of himself in order to gain redemption. Rich in ideas and history, this book helps us understand the situation in Northern Ireland--which &#34;is not just there,&#34; MacLaverty has remarked, &#34;as a colorful background.&#34;For Cal,some of the choices are devastatingly simple... He can work in an abattoir that nauseates him or join the dole queue; he can brood on his past or plan a future with Marcella. Springing out of the fear and violence of Ulster, <b>Cal</b> is a haunting love stroy in a land were tenderness and innocence can only flicker briefly in the dark.</p><h2>If All the Seas Were Ink: A Memoir</h2><p><p><b>**WINNER of the 2018 Sami Rohr Prize for Jewish Literature and the 2018 Sophie Brody Medal for achievement in Jewish literature**</b><br><b>**2018 Natan Book Award Finalist** </b><br><b></b><b>**Finalist for the 2017 National Jewish Book Award in Women's Studies **</b><br><b></b><i><b></b></i><br><b><i>The Wall Street Journal: </i></b>"There is humor and heartbreak in these pages...Ms. Kurshan immerses herself in the demands of daily Talmud study and allows the words of ancient scholars to transform the patterns of her own life."</p><p><i><b>The Jewish Standard:</b> </i>&#x201c;Brilliant, beautifully written, sensitive, original."</p><p><i><b>The Jerusalem Post:</b> </i>"A beautiful and inspiring book.

He lives in New York City.Starred Review. Grade 4-6&#x2013;Freedman begins this outstanding history by reminding his audience that the injustices of racial segregation did not happen that long ago in the United States. Throughout the book, he gives accounts of how much coordination and sacrifice went into conducting the Montgomery Bus Boycott&#x2013;far more than students are likely to imagine from the usual popular and oversimplified versions offered in textbooks and on television. There is a refreshing emphasis on depictions of regular people and forgotten local crusaders working together to make the boycott possible and triumphant, from inspiring descriptions of drivers getting up at dawn to take others to work to accounts of well-known civil-rights lawyers working to find the right plaintiff to challenge unjust laws. Freedman's prose style pulls readers into the narrative, integrating the actual recorded words and deeds of the people to tell the story. The high-quality, black-and-white photographs range from everyday scenes of African-American boycotters meeting, waiting for carpools, and protesting to representations of more famous figures, such as Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King, Jr., etc. Extensive chapter notes, an annotated selected bibliography, and a thorough index round out the exemplary presentation. Pair this volume with Ann Bausum's Freedom Riders (National Geographic) and Nikki Giovanni's Rosa (Holt, both 2005) for a powerful introduction to the Civil Rights Movement.&#x2013;Michael Santangelo, Brooklyn Public Library, NY<br><br>*Starred Review* As Freedman points out, the Montgomery Bus Boycott was a triumphant historical event, and there are numerous memoirs, articles, and scholarly works, for adults and for young readers, about the leaders and the ordinary heroes. In his signature clear prose, Freedman draws on the best of those personal stories and historical accounts to provide a dramatic overview of how the 381-day resistance to segregated buses spearheaded the civil rights movement. He brings close the experience of what it was like to be there, on the bus and on the street. With the eloquent accounts of the legendary heroes--Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King and more--are the stories of other important activists, including Jo Ann Robinson (president of the Women's Political Council) and teenager Claudette Colvin, as well as the lawyers and politicians. The photo-essay design is attractive and spacious. On every spread, readers will find beautifully reproduced black-and-white photos, including famous pictures as well as a few not often seen, including a picture of a leaflet urging boycott. Suggest Diane McWhorter's A Dream of Freedom (2004) and Ellen Levin's Freedom's Children (1993) to readers who will want to find out more.

The thinly disguised story of Hall&#39;s own life, it was banned outright upon publication and almost ruined her literary career.</p><p>Marguerite Radclyffe-Hall (1883-1943) was born in Hampshire and educated at King&#39;s College Cambridge. She published five volumes of poetry and seven novels. THE WELL OF LONELINESS, describing the lesbian &#39;invert&#39; Stephen, was banned on publication in 1928. Two years later she received the Eichelbergher Humane Award.<b>The Well of Loneliness</b> is a path-breaking novel. Published by Radclyffe Hall herself in 1928, it was immediately banned in Britain due to its lesbian theme and was allowed in the United States only after a long court battle. Once it was available, <b>The Well of Loneliness</b> sold more than 20,000 copies its first year and paved the way for other works with lesbian themes. The novel concerns a girl born into a wealthy English family at the turn of the century and named Stephen by her father who desperately wanted a boy. Practically from birth, Stephen is described as "different," yet while Radclyffe Hall delivers the powerful message that lesbianism is natural, she also asks the reader to have pity on Stephen Gordon, for, along with the popular psychoanalysts of her day, Radclyffe Hall describes lesbianism as an "inversion." The "terrible mark of Cain" compels Stephen to forsake the woman she loves to protect her from a life of ostracism. This message, along with Radclyffe Hall's portrayal of lesbians in stereotypical "butch" and "femme" roles, caused the book to be written off by feminists in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In addition, many readers today may find the language long-winded and the characters one-dimensional, with the exception of the thinly-veiled portrait of the author as Stephen Gordon. Nonetheless, <b>The Well of Loneliness</b> is worth reading because it shattered the silence of oppression and conveys a message about homophobia and internalized shame relevant to lesbians even today. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Heather Downey</i></p><h2>City of Lies (A Counterfeit Lady Novel)</h2><p><b>From the national bestselling author of the Gaslight Mysteries comes the first Counterfeit Lady novel&#x2014;the intriguing start of a historical mystery series featuring woman-on-the-run Elizabeth Miles.<br><br></b>Like most women, Elizabeth Miles assumes many roles; unlike most, <i>hers </i>have made her a woman on the run.

Elizabeth knows she&#x2019;s playing a risky game, and her deception could be revealed at any moment, possibly even by sharp-eyed Gideon. Nor has she been forgotten by Thornton, who&#x2019;s biding his time, waiting to strike. Elizabeth must draw on her wits and every last ounce of courage she possesses to keep her new life from being cut short by this vicious shadow from her past.</p><p><b>Victoria Thompson</b>&nbsp;is the Edgar� and Agatha award-nominated author of the Gaslight Mysteries&nbsp;as well as numerous historical novels.***This excerpt is from an advance uncorrected copy proof*** <br><br>Copyright � 2017 Victoria Thompson<br><br><p>Chapter I</p><p>Jake looked much too smug.</p><p>Elizabeth&#x2019;s hand itched to smack the smirk off his face, but well-bred young ladies didn&#x2019;t go around smacking people in hotel dining rooms. Since she was pretending to be a well-bred young lady at the moment, she made herself smile pleasantly and threaded her way through the mostly empty tables to where he was sitting.</p><p>He jumped to his feet and pulled out her chair, because he was pretending to be a well-bred young man. &#x201c;Good morning, dear sister. Did you sleep well?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did you drop the leather?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course, and he just came into the dining room. Oh, wait. He stopped to talk to someone.&#x201d;</p><p>Elizabeth glanced over, turning her head only slightly so she wouldn&#x2019;t be caught watching their mark. Jake had done the same thing.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a woman,&#x201d; Jake murmured.</p><p>&#x201c;Shhh.&#x201d; She could see that. She needed to hear what they said. If he had a friend in the city, someone who might advise him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&#x201c;Hazel, how nice to see you,&#x201d; Thornton said, although a trace of strain in his voice indicated it wasn&#x2019;t really so nice to see her at all.</p><p>&#x201c;Oscar,&#x201d; the woman said. Her back was to them but her tone was unmistakable. Elizabeth almost shivered from the frost in it. She&#x2019;d have to practice that tone. It might come in handy someday.</p><p>&#x201c;What brings you to Washington City?&#x201d; Thornton asked with obviously forced enthusiasm. He&#x2019;d also felt the chill and was trying to pretend he hadn&#x2019;t.</p><p>The woman rose to her feet, and even though she was much shorter than Oscar Thornton, she seemed to tower over him. How did she do that? &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe that is any of your concern.&#x201d; She laid her napkin down on the table and walked away, making Thornton look like a dog. How on earth did she do that? But Elizabeth couldn&#x2019;t worry about that now. She had to salvage Thornton&#x2019;s pride.</p><p>&#x201c;Start talking,&#x201d; Elizabeth whispered.</p><p>&#x201c;So I told him I wanted to order a dozen pair,&#x201d; Jake said a little louder than necessary so Thornton would know they&#x2019;d been talking to each other and hadn&#x2019;t noticed that woman cutting him dead so beautifully. Never embarrass a mark. &#x201c;And he looks down his nose at me, the way those clerks in those fancy stores do, and he says, &#x2018;Sir, you will never have use for a dozen pair.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t!&#x201d; Elizabeth said, outraged on behalf of her brother in this imaginary conversation.</p><p>&#x201c;He did. So I told him I&#x2019;d take two dozen instead.&#x201d;</p><p>She laughed the little tinkling laugh she&#x2019;d practiced so many times and said, &#x201c;Father will be furious.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why do you think I did it?&#x201d; Then he looked up in apparent surprise to see Thornton approaching their table. &#x201c;Good morning, Thornton. Won&#x2019;t you join us?&#x201d;</p><p>Elizabeth looked up, too, and gave him a delighted smile that told him how pleased she was to see him, because she was pleased, if not for the reason he thought. His face was still scarlet from the woman&#x2019;s snub, but she gave no indication she noticed. &#x201c;Yes, do join us and save me from having to listen to any more of my brother&#x2019;s silly stories.&#x201d;</p><p>Jake pretended to be affronted, but they soon had Thornton seated and responding to Elizabeth&#x2019;s subtle flirting. He probably hadn&#x2019;t forgotten that woman, but he was thinking about Elizabeth now, which was all that mattered.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh dear, are those women still marching at the White House?&#x201d; she asked, seeing the headline in the newspaper Thornton had carried with him.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, even though they&#x2019;re getting arrested almost daily now,&#x201d; Thornton said. He&#x2019;d cleared the last of the humiliation out of his voice, she noticed with relief.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why women would want to vote anyway. Would you, Betty?&#x201d; Jake asked, using the name they&#x2019;d chosen for this job.</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t imagine why,&#x201d; Elizabeth said. &#x201c;Politics is so boring.&#x201d; She didn&#x2019;t have to lie about her opinion of politics, at least.</p><p>&#x201c;And not something a lady should concern herself with,&#x201d; Thornton said with the condescending smile that set her teeth on edge.</p><p>Thornton told them the details of the suffragettes&#x2019; latest brush with the law while the waiter in his spotless white gloves served them eggs and potatoes and bacon and refilled their coffee cups. When they were nearly finished, Elizabeth said, &#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m sorry, Mr. Thornton.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;For what, my dear?&#x201d; he asked. He thought he was charming, and she let him think so.</p><p>&#x201c;I stepped on your foot.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, you didn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; he assured her.</p><p>Elizabeth frowned in confusion. &#x201c;It must have been you then, Jake.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, it wasn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I stepped on something,&#x201d; she said, pushing her chair back a bit and looking down at the floor. &#x201c;What could it be?&#x201d;</p><p>She couldn&#x2019;t see because of the tablecloth, so Thornton obligingly bent down to help look. Then he reached under the table and came up with a man&#x2019;s wallet.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve dropped your pocketbook, Perkins,&#x201d; he told Jake.</p><p>Jake patted his jacket. &#x201c;No, I haven&#x2019;t. Mine&#x2019;s right here. It must be yours.&#x201d;</p><p>Thornton patted his own jacket and shook his head. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not mine, either.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Someone&#x2019;s going to be very upset,&#x201d; Elizabeth said. &#x201c;Look how much money is in it.&#x201d;</p><p>Thornton had opened the wallet and discovered a large amount of cash inside.</p><p>&#x201c;How much is it, do you think?&#x201d; Jake asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Several hundred at least,&#x201d; Thornton said.</p><p>&#x201c;We need to find the owner and return it,&#x201d; Jake said. &#x201c;Is there anything in there with a name on it?&#x201d;</p><p>Thornton started emptying the wallet, which was stuffed not only with money but other papers as well. He laid the items out on the table, and Elizabeth and Jake moved the dishes aside to make room.</p><p>Jake picked up the stack of money and counted it while Thornton laid out several telegrams, a paper with a row of letters and numbers written on it, and a newspaper clipping.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s over six hundred dollars here,&#x201d; Jake said. Two year&#x2019;s salary for an average working man.</p><p>&#x201c;What does the newspaper clipping say?&#x201d; Elizabeth asked.</p><p>Thornton read it to himself. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about some fellow named Coleman making a killing in the stock market.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;These telegrams are to someone named Coleman, too,&#x201d; Jake noticed.</p><p>&#x201c;Is that his photograph?&#x201d; she asked, peering at the clipping in Thornton&#x2019;s fat fingers.</p><p>&#x201c;For all the good it does.&#x201d; He turned it so she could see. The photograph was of a man holding his hat to cover his face.</p><p>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t need his photograph if we have his name,&#x201d; Jake pointed out. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s probably staying at the hotel. Let&#x2019;s take it to him. I want to see his face when he gets it back.&#x201d;</p><p>Thornton glanced over at her. &#x201c;How do you feel about going to a strange man&#x2019;s hotel room, Miss Perkins?&#x201d;</p><p>She gave him a mischievous smile. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s scandalous, I know, but I&#x2019;ll be thoroughly chaperoned.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Indeed you will,&#x201d; Jake said with a grin.</p><p>While Jake stuffed everything back into the wallet, Thornton rose and pulled out her chair for her. She thanked him with a coy little smile that promised things she would never in this world deliver. Jake went on ahead to the front desk to see if Mr. Coleman was registered at the hotel. Which he was, of course, and he also happened to be in his suite at that very moment, the clerk reported after telephoning to find out.</p><p>Elizabeth should have been pleased. Everything was going perfectly. Jake was doing his part and she was doing hers. So why did she have that hollow feeling in her stomach every time she pictured how it would end?</p><p>The two men allowed her to go before them to the elevator, and Elizabeth felt Thornton&#x2019;s gaze on her like a slimy hand. She and Jake were pretending to be members of an &#x201c;old money&#x201d; family, but she was sure Thornton knew they weren&#x2019;t. She&#x2019;d gathered that his late wife had come from one of the old New York families, so he&#x2019;d know the difference. That didn&#x2019;t matter, though. Actually, it was better if he thought they weren&#x2019;t rich. He only needed to believe she was interested in him, and a young woman of limited means would certainly be interested in a single man of apparently unlimited means, no matter if he wasn&#x2019;t particularly handsome or very young.</p><p>And Jake had determined that Thornton had the means while they chatted in the smoking car on the train down from New York. If he was green in other areas, Jake was a master at getting marks to talk.</p><p>The elevator operator deposited them on the top floor.</p><p>&#x201c;The rooms up here are pretty nice,&#x201d; Jake remarked as they walked down the hall. &#x201c;I wanted to get a suite, but Betty wouldn&#x2019;t hear of it,&#x201d; Perkins said.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a waste of money,&#x201d; she said, reinforcing Thornton&#x2019;s suspicions that they weren&#x2019;t actually rich.</p><p>&#x201c;This is it,&#x201d; Thornton said when he found the room.</p><p>&#x201c;Betty, you stand out of sight,&#x201d; Jake said, &#x201c;in case this fellow doesn&#x2019;t take the news in a friendly way or something.&#x201d;</p><p>Elizabeth gave him a surprised look, but Thornton said, &#x201c;Stand behind me and slip away if things get ugly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; she said, stepping back to allow Thornton to protect her. He was probably hoping they did have to slip away. Left to his own devices, he most likely would have just pocketed Coleman&#x2019;s cash and left the wallet for the hotel staff to find, so they&#x2019;d get blamed for stealing the money.</p><p>Jake knocked.</p><p>After a few moments, the door opened a little and a suspicious man peered out at them. &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Coleman?&#x201d; Jake said.</p><p>&#x201c;Who wants to know?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Jake Perkins and this is Oscar Thornton. We&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stop bothering me. I already told you, I&#x2019;m not giving any more interviews.&#x201d;</p><p>He started to close the door but Jake threw up a hand to stop him. &#x201c;We found your wallet downstairs in the dining room, and we&#x2019;re returning it.&#x201d;</p><p>The man frowned at the wallet Jake held up. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t lost my wallet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d;</p><p>He patted his jacket impatiently, just the way Thornton had downstairs, but he didn&#x2019;t find the telltale bulge he was expecting. He patted some more and felt around in all his pockets. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right, I do seem to have lost my wallet. I&#x2019;m sorry to be so rude, but I thought you were newspaper reporters. They hound me all the time, which is one reason I came to Washington City. I thought I could get away from them here. Please, come in, gentlemen.&#x201d; He held the door open. &#x201c;Oh, and young lady,&#x201d; he added when Thornton stepped aside to allow Elizabeth to proceed him.</p><p>&#x201c;My sister, Miss Perkins,&#x201d; Jake said.</p><p>&#x201c;Pleased to meet you,&#x201d; Coleman said with a nod. &#x201c;Come in, all of you.&#x201d;</p><p>The suite was even nicer than Elizabeth had expected, with a view of the White House grounds across the way.</p><p>&#x201c;I guess you can identify this,&#x201d; Jake said, holding up the wallet again.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course. Let&#x2019;s see, I had a few hundred dollars, five or six, I think. Some telegrams, and a list of ciphers. Oh, and a newspaper clipping. Is that close enough?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, it is,&#x201d; Jake assured him. He handed over the wallet with a little flourish he probably thought was cute. Elizabeth managed not to roll her eyes.</p><p>She watched Thornton&#x2019;s surprise when Coleman didn&#x2019;t count the money to make sure it was all there the way Thornton probably would have. Instead, Coleman pulled out the piece of paper with the rows of letters and numbers and tossed the wallet with its wad of cash carelessly onto the table. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t thank you enough for returning this. I wouldn&#x2019;t have missed the money at all, but without this paper, I&#x2019;d be out of business.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We were wondering what that was,&#x201d; Thornton said. &#x201c;What did you call it? A cipher?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. Say, can I offer you fellows a drink? And some sherry for you, miss? I know it&#x2019;s early, but I feel like celebrating. Please, sit down and join me.&#x201d;</p><p>Jake gave Thornton a questioning look, and Thornton shrugged. She was sure he never turned down a free drink.</p><p>Coleman poured a generous amount of whiskey into three glasses and a small amount of sherry into a stemmed glass for her and handed them around.</p><p>&#x201c;You have good taste in whiskey, Coleman,&#x201d; Thornton said after a taste.</p><p>&#x201c;What kind of business are you in that you need a cipher?&#x201d; Jake asked. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t even know what that is.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s all very hush-hush, but I think you folks have proved you&#x2019;re trustworthy. I work for a combine of Wall Street brokers who are trying to break up the branch stock exchanges and the bucket shops. They control the rise and fall of large blocks of stock, and they send me around the country and tip me off when to buy and sell. You probably saw those telegrams in my wallet. They&#x2019;re written in code, telling me what stocks to buy and sell. Without this cipher, I wouldn&#x2019;t know what they were saying, and I&#x2019;d probably lose my job.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And they pay you to do that?&#x201d; Jake asked in amazement.</p><p>&#x201c;No, they don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Coleman said with wink. &#x201c;But they do let me keep the money I make when I sell the stocks. Say, I feel like I should give you some kind of reward for returning my wallet since you saved my bacon. I know you don&#x2019;t need the money, but how about if I give each of you fellows a hundred to cover your expenses while you&#x2019;re in town at least?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s awfully sporting of you, Coleman,&#x201d; Thornton started to say, probably thinking a hundred sounded good, but someone knocked on the door and called, &#x201c;Telegram!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Excuse me,&#x201d; Coleman said and went to answer.</p><p>&#x201c;Say, Thornton, did you ever hear of a scheme like this?&#x201d; Jake whispered while Coleman was busy with the bellhop.</p><p>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; Thornton said, although he was most certainly lying. &#x201c;Those Wall Street types are always manipulating the market somehow.&#x201d; Which was probably true, at least.</p><p>Coleman tipped the bellhop and sent him on his way. Then he hurried over to the desk and consulted his cipher to translate the telegram he&#x2019;d just received. When he&#x2019;d finished, he said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve just gotten instructions to buy some stocks, so I&#x2019;m going to have to go to the brokerage right away. Before I do, though, I want to give you fellows your reward.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We couldn&#x2019;t take a reward,&#x201d; Jake said, completely ignoring the black look Thornton was giving him. &#x201c;Anybody would&#x2019;ve done the same thing.&#x201d;</p><p>Thornton wouldn&#x2019;t have, Elizabeth was certain, but Coleman said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be too sure of that, young fellow. I know you&#x2019;re both honorable men, but I still think I owe you something. Tell you what&#x2014;why don&#x2019;t I take the two hundred I was going to give you and buy stock with it for each of you? This order I just got is going to pay off big, and I&#x2019;m going to sell by the end of the day, so you can keep the original investment and whatever your share earns. It should at least double.&#x201d;</p><p>Even Thornton smiled at that prospect. &#x201c;I think I could live with that, Coleman.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know much about stock, but it sounds good to me,&#x201d; Jake said. &#x201c;If it&#x2019;s going to double, I have a notion to give you fifty of my own, too, if you wouldn&#x2019;t mind.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, Jake, do you really think you should?&#x201d; Elizabeth said with a worried frown.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right to be careful, Miss Perkins, but in this case, you can&#x2019;t go wrong,&#x201d; Coleman said. &#x201c;I can guarantee your brother will double his money.&#x201d;</p><p>Before Elizabeth could protest again, Jake pulled out his wallet and passed Coleman a fifty.</p><p>&#x201c;How about it, Thornton?&#x201d; Jake said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you want t...</p></p><h2>The Cave of Time (Choose Your Own Adventure)</h2><p>The reader enters a mysterious cave and by following the instructions on each page can have several different adventures backward and forward in time</p><p>The Star! 40 Thrilling&nbsp;&nbsp;Endings!<br><br><i>Will You Become Trapped&nbsp;&nbsp;In Time</i> ?<br><br>You&nbsp;&nbsp;are hiking in Snake Canyon when you find yourself&nbsp;&nbsp;lost in the strange, dimly lit Cave of Time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gradually you can make out two passageways.

She accounts for the role of the death drive by coining the term &#34;love/hate.&#34;</p><p>In &#39;Tales of Love&#39; Julia Kristeva pursues her exploration of the basic emotions that affect the human psyche. The processes are similar to those followed in &#39;Powers of Horror&#39;.

Or Buddha? Or Oscar Wilde? Maybe you have a friend who practices another religion or admires a more contemporary figure. Drop in on a conversation between Jesus and some well-known individuals whose search for the meaning of life took them in many directions -- and influenced millions. Popular scholar Ravi Zacharias sets a captivating scene in this first in the intriguing Conversations with Jesus books. Through dialogue between Christ and Gautama Buddha that reveals Jesus&#39; warm, impassioned concern for all people, God&#39;s true nature is explored. It&#39;s a well-priced, hard cover volume readers will want to own, and also share with others.</p><p>Ravi Zacharias was born in India, immigrating to Canada at age twenty. After earning a Masters of Divinity at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, he began a speaking ministry that has taken him worldwide (including the campuses of Harvard, Princeton, and Oxford University) as a recognized authority on comparative religions, cults, and philosophy. Zacharias&#39; holds three doctorate degrees, and his books include the Gold Medallion winner Can Man Live without God, Deliver Us from Evil, Cries of the Heart, Jesus Among Other Gods, and two children&#39;s titles. He teaches a weekly, international radio program entitled Let My People Think. Ravi lives with his wife, Margaret, in Atlanta. They have three grown children.<b>Introduction</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Writing this book has been an incredible experience. I spent scores of hours in temples with monks and with instructors of students of Buddhist thought. The discussions I had were always cordial and delightful. Over many a cup of tea, we lingered and talked about life&#x2019;s deepest questions and contrasting answers.<br>&nbsp;<br>Having enjoyed such rapport with those who embrace the Buddhist worldview, I found it difficult to highlight the deep differences between Buddhism and Christianity and not bring offense. Those differences may be discomforting, but they are real. Even the answers the monks gave to my questions were not always the same depending on which school of Buddhism they represented. At times there was frustration on their faces when the questions became tough and their answers dissimilar. But even in the midst of disagreements, they drew comfort from the fact that, for them, agreement was not as important as the pursuit itself.<br>&nbsp;<br>I will always be grateful for their courtesy and hospitality. Although we have radically different answers to life&#x2019;s fundamental questions, we dare not shrink from asking the hard questions just to avoid discomfort.<br>&nbsp;<br>Although a book like this could be slanted any way one pleases, some fundamental ideas are inescapable and must be engaged. In that sense, at least, I trust I have presented the ideas fairly and subjected them to scrutiny. Many of those I talked with will be reading this, and I look forward to their responses. Jesus and Buddha cannot both be right. The lotus is the symbol of Buddhism; the cross, the symbol of the Christian faith. Behind the two symbols stand two diametrically opposed beliefs. I ask you, the reader, to examine the message of each, using both your heart and your mind. It is worth the exercise because it will determine your destiny. One day we will all find out that being respectful and sincere does not give us license to be wrong. Truth demands investigation and commitment. Our conclusions must be in keeping with Truth that can be tested. To be handcuffed by a lie is the worst of all imprisonments. May the God of all truth lead you to the Truth that sets you free indeed.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Prologue</b><br>It is the first blush of dawn as I step into this long-tailed boat after haggling with the boatman for a suitable price. His jolly countenance and leathery skin tell a story all their own. His toothless grin is a cartoonist&#x2019;s dream, and a comb has not visited his sparse scalp for ages. If one has to wake up this early, the sight of him beats the face of a clock any day.<br>&nbsp;<br>He has agreed to take me on a journey along the famed River of Kings. We wend our way through back canals that teem with life, dotted by the corrugated iron rooftops along shores that house a large part of this megacity. A sense of nostalgia surfaces within me as the slumbering multitude begins to stir among the backdrop of temples and pagodas spiraling toward the sky. It is as if the calendar collides here, the past, present, and future all speaking in unison. The morning air is fragrant with aromas ranging from lemongrass to fish sauce, all being prepared for the day&#x2019;s consumption. Yes, the food here wins the palate of virtually every traveler. This is a city I have<br>visited often and its people are among the most winsome in the world. The smiles, the graces, and the charms exude as in no other land I know. A carefree attitude toward life is writ large in the cultural ethos, and strangers make you feel very welcome, even when one may have just cheated you into buying a fake name-brand watch or a pirated copy of the latest movie.<br>&nbsp;<br>I am very much at home on this continent, for it reminds me so much of the land of my birth. But there is a reality here that compels me to ask some hard questions about life. Within this culture, the most reverent of expressions mix with the most unashamed abandon for the sensual. I see a monk walking in the distance, a bowl for begging in his hand, but I also see a man who spends most of his day waylaying tourists and seducing them with pictures to come and visit a nearby brothel. He does that from dawn to dusk, seven days a week. It is quite a juxtaposition: the monk, austere and in pursuit of nirvana; the man, with a roguish smile, promising a different kind of bliss.<br>&nbsp;<br>Here a cultural immersion would be impossible without visiting a host of temples&#x2014;the Emerald Buddha, the Reclining Buddha, the Golden Buddha, and a long list of others. But here, too, the newspapers sound a somber tone. The income from prostitution, they declare, exceeds the entire national budget. Here, drugs and AIDS have ravaged the population, and sincere politicians are trying desperately to deal with it. But this very city is exploited by money-hungry opportunists who bring in planeloads of men, promising them orgies to fulfill every imaginable craving.<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>And so as I sit in this sputtering boat, smothered in a misty spray, I feel nearly drowned in a sea of emotions. How does one talk about the eternal when both religion and riotous living argue that nothing is permanent? An odd mix of the glory and the shame of humanity within this microcosm ignites a series of difficult questions.<br>&nbsp;<br>As we make our way down the canal, able to look almost directly into the living quarters of those who live along its shores, I cannot shake the memory of a newspaper article on the front page the previous day. It told the story of a young, attractive woman who left home to earn a living, only to pay the heaviest price of all: the devastation of AIDS. This a summary of that story:<br>&nbsp;<br>At seventeen, young and beautiful Priya decided to head to the big city to work. Within hours of her arrival, the very friend who had enticed her with the promise of big money mercilessly raped her. Thus began a fourteen-year stretch of untold heartache and tragedy. As if to mend Priya&#x2019;s torn spirit, the &#x201c;friend&#x201d; found her a job as a seamstress. But even there Priya found no relief from the plundering ways of those she had cast her lot with. She was soon being used and abused to deviant ends, only with a new twist&#x2014;she was paid for satisfying their perverse pleasures. By the age of twenty-three she had become a full-fledged prostitute, managed by a handful of thugs who<br>shared in the spoils.<br>&nbsp;<br>Fate struck hard one day when she became pregnant. For a few months her profession was put on hold. Inevitably, financial strain set in, and she could hardly wait to give birth to the child so she could give it away, then return to the sordid life that had enslaved her.<br>&nbsp;<br>But a more devastating shock awaited her: She discovered that she was HIV-positive. She could not discontinue her lifestyle, for she needed the money to treat her disease and hang onto life. Hardened, calloused, and almost vengeful, she continued to sell her services to hundreds of customers, including bankers, businessmen, and doctors, of whom she kept a detailed record. She knew she was signing each man&#x2019;s death warrant, but she was drowning in despair, and her life had lost all value. <br>&nbsp;<br>Eventually she could no longer hide the disfiguring marks of her disease. Blisters blanketed her body. She resorted to desperate methods in search of a cure, even boiling a toad and drinking the<br>water, a practice that villagers believed might cure her. She made numerous attempts to kill herself, only to fail each time. Finally Priya poisoned herself once more, and this time she set her house on fire and lay down for the last time, enshrouded in flames.<br>&nbsp;<br>Her once-beautiful body was reduced to ashes. No one would even come close to her charred remains for fear of infection. She died alone. And not far from her others played the same<br>deadly game, thinking that this same end would never be theirs.<br>&nbsp;<br>How can I forget this story? My heart is heavy as I remember it. Are some of the faces I see this morning headed toward the same fearsome future? I am told that hundreds, if not thousands, have made their way to this very city over the years, and that the script has been the same for scores of them.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>What, Lord Jesus, would You have said to Priya, had she brought her decrepit body and aching heart to You? </i>(Actually, many women in similar situations did come to Jesus.)<br>&nbsp;<br>And what would Buddha have said to her, this being a land where 95 percent of its people are Buddhists? Interestingly, the faces of suffering were what led Gautama (the birth name of Buddha) to pursue the answers to such grief, and in that pursuit, he became the Buddha, the &#x201c;Enlightened One.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>A waterfall of questions flows over me, and my mind is caught in a vortex of possibilities. What, I wonder, would Buddha or Jesus say to <i>each other </i>if they were in this boat with me, breathing the pungent smells, witnessing the extreme sights, hearing the lively sounds, and discussing the plight of this young woman? Many Buddhist scholars have drawn parallels between Buddha&#x2019;s and Jesus&#x2019; teachings; one noted scholar even called them &#x201c;brothers.&#x201d; Is that an accurate portrayal? Or did this scholar, among others, completely miss the fundamental differences? <br>&nbsp;<br>I let my imagination take a ride and picture just such a conversation.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Trump: The Way to the Top: The Best Business Advice I Ever Received</h2><p>The host of the hit reality show The Apprentice presents an invaluable collection of grounded, hard-hitting advice on business success, from people who have made it to the boss&#x2019;s chair at some of America&#x2019;s most thriving companies. <br><br>How can you find the way to the top? <br><br>Ask people who are already there.<br><br>Because you can&#x2019;t know it all. No matter how smart you are, no matter how comprehensive your education, no matter how wide-ranging your business experience, there&#x2019;s simply no way to acquire all the wisdom you need to make your business flourish. You need to learn from those who have blazed a trail before you. <br><br>Donald Trump has asked many of the brightest, most successful businesspeople he knows&#x2014;and some he doesn't know&#x2014;to answer this question: What's the best business advice you ever received? The result is a compelling resource of wisdom and wit that reveals how some of the most accomplished people conduct their personal and business affairs, giving an inside look into the secrets of corporate success. But the advice doesn&#x2019;t only come from the upper echelons of the Fortune 500. Thoughts poured in from executives at thriving companies large and small, ranging from well-known icons such as Staples, American Airlines, Lillian Vernon, and Boeing to family-run operations like Orleans Homebuilders and Carlson Companies.<br><br><b>The Way to the Top</b> brings together the core ideas that have guided more than 150 of today&#x2019;s top businesspeople, offering a range of inspiring and practical advice on making good decisions, conducting yourself appropriately, developing your career, communicating with others, leading a team effectively, and much more. Some of the entries are simple entreaties, some portray intriguing vignettes, and others outline lists of guiding principles; all are illuminating, instructive, and insightful.<br><br>A telling to-do list for the aspiring professional, <b>The Way to the Top</b> belongs on every business bookshelf.</p><p>Donald J. Trump is known worldwide for his business acumen. He is the very definition of the American success story, continually setting the standards of excellence while expanding his interests in real estate, gaming, sports, and entertainment.Acknowledging that "you can&#x2019;t know it all," tough-minded businessman and recent television star Trump asked more than 100 successful businesspeople to tell him "the best business advice they have ever received." His newest volume compiles their responses into easily digestible tidbits that range from the realistically prescient ("The sun doesn&#x2019;t shine forever," from Barbara Berger, president of Food City Markets) to the stoically practical ("Don&#x2019;t confuse efforts with results," Thomas J. Barrack, CEO of Colony Capital). Though most of the book&#x2019;s entries are no longer than half a page, a few contributors, such as Barbara Corcoran (founder of the Corcoran Real Estate Group) and Thomas Chen (president of Crystal Window and Door Systems), have written longer entries that reveal as much about their authors as they do about good business sense. Serious readers of business books may be disappointed by some of more lackluster contributions (e.g. "the secret of having a good business is to be in a good business"), but there are enough sage words here to satisfy most fans of The Apprentice.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Not even&nbsp;&nbsp;the savagery of the French and Indian wars could&nbsp;&nbsp;cool their fury or halt their power. But by 1770&nbsp;&nbsp;the restless white men were warring once again.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thayendanegea, the valiant Iroquois war chief,&nbsp;&nbsp;allied his fierce tribes with the one white man the&nbsp;&nbsp;Indians loved and trusted, Sir William Johnson.

Includes a 30-page bibliographical essay, numerous illustrations, and a full-color pictorial biography of the composer.</p><p>Maynard Solomon is that rarest of writers on classical music: a well-trained expert who is also gutsy and humane, and who knows about life. He had the courage to write in recent years about Franz Schubert's homosexuality, which, judging by the size of the polemic that ensued, some academics were still not ready to hear about. But for many readers, Solomon's masterpiece is still his 1977 biography of Beethoven, offered here in a revised second edition that is a must-read for anyone interested in classical music, let alone "The Big Deaf One," as Jean Cocteau referred to the composer. Artfully blending history, psychology, sociology, and musicology in just the right measures, Solomon has taken the opportunity in his revision to focus more on certain themes, like Beethoven and Freemasonry; to discount evidence now seen as suspect, including the forgeries of the composer's friend Schindler; and to present new finds such as recently discovered documentary evidence. The result stands with Thayer's biography and Tovey's analyses as the classics on Beethoven, along with other fascinating books like the Cambridge Music Handbook on Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. A triumph--bravo, Professor Solomon! <i>--Benjamin Ivry</i>This book contains the following features: A 30-page Bibliographical Essay; 55 illustrations; Notes, Index.</p><h2>The Library of Easy Piano Classics 2</h2><p>A compendium of over 100 of the world&#39;s most beloved masterpieces by the great composers.

These changes, according to the authors (publishers of the newsletter Strategic Investment ), are unseen by the individual and occur over long periods. They include the effects of British and American hegemony in the world economy and the effects of Communism, the Japanese economy, and Middle East terrorism. After reviewing these megapolitical events in some detail, the authors relate them to the goals of the investor by offering detailed principles and mechanics.

Yet in spite of these great challenges, Brueggemann calls us to journey together to the common good through neighborliness, covenanting, and reconstruction. Such a concept may seem overwhelming, but writing with his usual theological acumen and social awareness Brueggemann distills this challenge to its most basic issues: where is the church going? What is its role in contemporary society? What lessons does it have to offer a world enmeshed in such turbulent times? The answer is the same answer God gave to the Israelites thousands of years ago: love your neighbor and work for the common good. Brueggemann considers biblical texts as examples of the journey now required of the faithful if they wish to move from isolation and distrust to a practice of neighborliness, as an invitation to a radical choice for life or for death, and as a reliable script for overcoming contemporary problems of loss and restoration in a failed urban economy.</p></p><p><b>Walter Brueggemann</b> is William Marcellus McPheeters Professor Emeritus of Old Testament at Columbia Theological Seminary in Decatur, Georgia.

It is now the basis for an acclaimed new film.(1906 - 1977) James Meyers Thompson was born in Anadarko, Oklahoma. He began writing fiction at a very young age, selling his first story to <i>True Detective</i> when he was only fourteen. Thompson eventually wrote twenty-nine novels, all but three of which were published as paperback originals. Thompson also wrote two screenplays (for the Stanley Kubrick films &#x201c;The Killing&#x201d; and &#x201c;Paths of Glory&#x201d;). An outstanding crime writer, the world of his fiction is rife with violence and corruption. In examining the underbelly of human experience and American society in particular, Thompson&#x2019;s work at its best is both philosophical and experimental. Several of his novels have been filmed by American and French directors, resulting in classic noir including <b>The Killer Inside Me</b> (1952), <b>After Dark My Sweet</b> (1955), and <b>The Grifters</b> (1963).</p><h2>Alice In The Country Of Hearts, Vol. 2</h2><p>Kidnapped by a handsome man with rabbit ears, Alice Liddell finds herself abandoned in an odd place called Wonderland and thrust into a &#39;game,&#39; the rules of which she has yet to learn.

Conceived, written, and directed by a little-known filmmaker named George Lucas, <em>Star Wars</em> reinvented the cinematic landscape, ushering in a new way for movies to be made, marketed, and merchandised. Now it is one of the most adored--and successful--movie franchises of all time. <br><br> Lucas went on to create the Indiana Jones series, transform the world of special effects, and forever change the way movies sound. His innovation and ambition forged some of today's most prominent companies, including Pixar, Lucasfilm, THX sound, and Industrial Light &amp; Magic.

Rather than list a series of restaurant recipes, he uses simple steps to deconstruct a chef's creative process, making it easily available to any home cook.<br><br>He starts with techniques: What's roasting, for example, and how do you do it in the oven or on top of the stove? He also gets you comfortable with braising, saut�ing, and making stocks and sauces. Next he introduces simple "ingredients" -- roasted tomatoes, say, or braised artichokes -- and tells you how to use them in a variety of ways. So those easy roasted tomatoes may be turned into anything from a vinaigrette to a caramelized tomato tart, with many delicious options in between.<br><br>In a section called Trilogies, Tom takes three ingredients and puts them together to make one dish that's quick and other dishes that are increasingly more involved. As Tom says, "Juxtaposed in interesting ways, these ingredients prove that the whole can be greater than the sum of their parts," and you'll agree once you've tasted the Ragout of Asparagus, Morels, and Ramps or the Baked Free-Form "Ravioli" -- both dishes made with the same trilogy of ingredients.<br><br>The final section of the books offers simple recipes for components -- from zucchini with lemon thyme to roasted endive with whole spices to boulangerie potatoes -- that can be used in endless combinations.<br><br>Written in Tom's warm and friendly voice and illustrated with glorious photographs of finished dishes, <b>Think Like a Chef</b> will bring out the master chef in all of us.</p><p>Cookbooks by chefs can be daunting. They're apt to include tricky restaurant recipes, or, alternately, watered-down "translations." Tom Colicchio, chef at Manhattan's top-rated Gramercy Tavern, has a better way. Think like a chef, he advises, and you tap into food preparation creativity--the ability to forgo recipes, when you wish, for spontaneous kitchen invention. In a series of innovative chapters that explore cooking fundamentals, culinary themes and variations, and "plug-in" component preparations, Colicchio provides a cooking "anatomy" for gaining kitchen mastery. The book's 100-plus recipes are offered not as ends in themselves (though they stand as delicious examples of Colicchio's simple yet sophisticated style), but as illustrative keys to the culinary processes. <p> How does it work? Beginning with a chapter that reviews basic cooking techniques, and includes exemplary stock- and sauce-making formulas, the book then presents a series of "studies," building-block recipes like Roasted Tomatoes, followed by simple-to-sophisticated variations, such as Roasted-Tomato Risotto. A chapter called "Trilogies" explores clusters of three-ingredient recipes--duck, root vegetables, and apples is one ingredient grouping--that show how various techniques, applied to the same ingredients, yield various exciting dishes. "Component Cooking," which focuses on vegetables (Colicchio's major source of inspiration), provides recipes like Corn and Potato Pancakes to be used for assembling a "plate." Concluding the book is "Favorites," a selection of Colicchio's specialties that range from My Favorite Chicken Soup to Poached Foie Gras, a taste bonus that also stimulates the cooking imagination. Illustrated with more than 100 color photos, and including a wide range of tips, <i>Think Like a Chef</i> succeeds at helping readers see through a chef's eyes--and in so doing to visualize cooking with fresh insight. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>"In <b>Think Like a Chef</b>, Tom has opened the door to his culinary process and explained--in straight terms--how his very personal style is actually based on a simple logic that can be employed successfully by anyone who simply loves great food."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>--Danny Meyer</p><h2>Tell Me a Scary Story... But Not Too Scary! (Book &amp; Audio CD)</h2><p>A little boy has an adventure in the scary basement of his mysterious new neighbor, Mr. Neewollah.</p><p>For all those kids who love to be scared on Halloween--but not <i>too</i> scared, award-winning director and comedy writer Carl Reiner produces a real spine chiller. He also offers plenty of outs for the faint of heart: "Is it getting too scary for you? Should I keep going? Okay, if you say so." No red-blooded young reader will be able to resist this tantalizing tale of monsters and mystery. The narrator (depicted by Jerry Seinfeld's <i>Halloween</i> illustrator, James Bennett, to look exactly like Carl Reiner) cozies up with his granddaughter to tell her all about the man he met when he was a child: Mr. Neewollah. Mr. Neewollah has a crooked smile (we have several creepy child's-eye views) and some very strange hobbies. Young Carl is lured into his basement workshop only to be scared out of his wits by fake eyeballs, creaking doors, and creepy things covered with cloth--not to mention hideous monsters. But is Mr. Neewollah truly as sinister as he seems? <p> In his first book for children, Reiner gets that kids love to be spooked--and to know that all is well, too. Bennett's exaggerated illustrations, featuring weird angles and vivid, in-your-face close-ups, are a good match for Reiner&#x2019;s Halloween tale. Too busy in your own evil workshop to read aloud to the kids? Fear not! The book includes a CD featuring Reiner reading the story accompanied by eerie sound effects.

Presenting this remarkable set of diaries which span the critical period between 1841 and 1864, Carol Bleser allows one prominent planter and slaveholder to speak as himself and for himself.<br> James Henry Hammond, resembling a character in a Faulkner novel, was a poor boy who married into wealth and then fought to make his South Carolina plantations and slaveholdings among the largest in the South. An articulate intellectual active in politics as a congressman, U.S. senator, and South Carolina governor, he became a leading spokesman for the Cotton Kingdom in the last years before the Civil War. He dominated his family, sexually violated his young nieces (causing a scandal that nearly wrecked his career), and fathered children by his slaves. All the while, he kept his "secret and sacred" diaries, almost all of which survived and have existed only in archives until now.<br> Bleser masterfully edits the diaries, preserving their historical validity so that Hammond's unvarnished voice speaks out clearly on everything from his personal travails to the turbulent politics and key personalities of his age. Moreover, her introduction illuminates Hammond's background and paves the way for the general reader so that the diaries read like a novel, sweeping through the drama and ultimate disaster of the Old South. A vivid portrait emerges of a man whose wealth and intellect combined to make him an important Southern leader, but whose deep character flaws kept him from the true greatness to which he aspired.</p><p><br><em>About the Editor</em>:<br> <strong>Carol Bleser</strong> is the Kathryn and Calhoun Lemon Distinguished Professor of History at Clemson University. She is the author of <em>Promised Land: The History of the South Carolina Land Commission, 1869-1890</em> and editor of <em>The Hammonds of Redcliffe</em>, an annotated collection of the Hammond family correspondence over four generations.<br>These previously unpublished diaries of Hammond, an antebellum parvenu South Carolina politician, planter and staunch advocate of an independent South who served as U.S. senator and governor of South Carolina, provide a startlingly candid insight into a brilliant but ruthlessly ambitious, tyrannical man who was also a keen observer and critic of the Old South and its plantation aristocracy. Hammond's uncontrolled sensuality, which he indulged with his slaves and his own nieces, caused not only estrangement from his wife but proved politically self-destructive. In his journals, skillfully edited by Bleser ( The Hammonds of Redcliffe ), this admittedly frustrated novelist gave vent to his anger, dreams and self-pity, comparing himself to Sisyphus and blaming everyone including God for his failures. Also vividly portrayed are the suffering and disruption of plantation life during the Civil War and Hammond's growing despair at his own decadence and the defeat of his beloved South. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sweet Danger: Albert Campion #5 (Volume 5)</h2><p><p>After centuries as a Balkan backwater, the sleepy town of Averna has overnight become a stunningly valuable port, thanks to an earthquake that rejiggered the regional topography. But to whose coffers will that value accrue? Albert Campion has a hunch that the answer is to be found in a tiny Suffolk village, where a peculiar and dead broke family may be able to lay claim to the Averna fortune, provided they can produce the requisite proof of lineage. The proof? Nothing terribly difficult: Just your average ancient riddle, stolen drum, long-lost bell, priceless crown, and, oh yes, a necklace of disappearing rubies.</p></p><p><p>Margery Allingham is one of the best-known names in mystery fiction The "Campion" novels have been extensively televised, and broadcast in the U.S. and UK; a new series in currently under option. Who's Likely to Like This? Fans of Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayers, Edmund Crispin and other writers of Britain's "Golden Age" </p>With a hint of danger and international politics at stake, Albert Campion travels from the French Riviera to a small village in Essex, England, trying to solve a one-hundred-year-old riddle. With his British accent, narrator Francis Matthews finds exactly the right tone for Campion--very proper, sometimes alert and sharp, but usually (intentionally) vacuous and foolish. His three upper-crust companions are harder to differentiate at times. Matthews does well with the Cockney accents and Midlands dialects and with the supporting cast, especially the pugnacious Lugg. Additionally, he gives Amanda all the enthusiasm, intelligence, and lack of self-consciousness that charms Albert completely. In keeping with Allingham's prose, Matthews brings the reader unhurriedly along, slowly building towards the tense but satisfying end.

By the author of Serpent Mage. 60,000 first printing. $60,000 ad/promo.</p><p>Chaos is everywhere as the Lord of the Nexus orders his servant Haplo and the human child known as Bane to further their master&#39;s work on Arianus, the realm of air. But their one time companion Alfred has been cast into the deadly Labyrinth. And somehow the assassin Hugh the Hand has been resurrected to complete his dark mission. More important, the evil force that Haplo and Alfred discovered on Arianus has escaped. As Haplo&#39;s doubts about his master grow deeper, he must decide whether to obey the Lord of the Nexus or betray the powerful Patryn... and endeavor to bring peace to the universe.Volume five of the apparently interminable Death Gate Cycle (Serpent Mage, 1992, etc.). Now that the evil-magic serpents of the water-world Chelestra have escaped through the Death Gate, new power alliances are possible--such as that between the serpents and Xar, Haplo's powerful Patryn boss. Despite Haplo's feeble warnings about the serpents' malevolent intentions (they can assume any shape, retaining only tell-tale red eyes), Xar dispatches Haplo and his yappy-dog sidekick to the air-world Arianus, with orders to set species against species and generally create chaos among the lower- order ``mensch.'' And this time Haplo's old rival/accomplice, Albert the Sartan, languishes trapped inside the Labyrinth. So, by himself Haplo must somehow stop the elf-dwarf war by helping the human and elf magicians while placating Xar and devising a means to repel the serpents--oh, yes, and preventing various assassinations, including his own. A hypercomplicated plot whose increasingly improbable convolutions seem designed only to distract attention from the ludicrously implausible scenario, plodding narrative, and irritatingly obtuse characters. Which, being translated into Fannish, means: another smash hit. (First printing of 60,000) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He lives in New York City.Rather than seeing affirmative action developing out of the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s, Katznelson (<i>Desolation and Enlightenment</i>) finds its origins in the New Deal policies of the 1930s and 1940s. And instead of seeing it as a leg up for minorities, Katznelson argues that the prehistory of affirmative action was supported by Southern Democrats who were actually devoted to preserving a strict racial hierarchy, and that the resulting legislation was explicitly designed for the majority: its policies made certain, he argues, that whites received the full benefit of rising prosperity while blacks were deliberately left out. Katznelson supports this startling claim ingeniously, showing, for instance, that while the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act was a great boon for factory workers, it did nothing for maids and agricultural laborers&#x2014;employment sectors dominated by blacks at the time&#x2014;at the behest of Southern politicians. Similarly, Katznelson makes a strong case that the GI Bill, an ostensibly color-blind initiative, unfairly privileged white veterans by turning benefits administration over to local governments, thereby ensuring that Southern blacks would find it nearly impossible to participate. This intriguing study closes with suggestions for rectifying racial inequality, but its strongest merit is its subtle recalibration of a crucial piece of American history. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Their words speak to an orientation or an idea, but those orientations and ideas are never complete. Artists (of all kinds) are only partly aware of what they do. Much of what happens in making art is unconscious. But in these comments, Picasso, Beckmann, and de Kooning all connect their art to feeling&#x2014;to love in the first two cases and to irritation in the third&#x2014;and for each artist, women have somehow been implicated in the process. For Picasso, loving a woman is a metaphor for painting. His &#x201c;we&#x201d; is clearly masculine. Beckmann is giving advice to an imaginary &#x201c;woman painter,&#x201d; and de Kooning is trying to explain how his &#x201c;women&#x201d; were created by evoking the woman in himself, albeit in a defensive and worried way. All three claim that there is a fundamental feeling relation between their inner states and the reality of the canvas, and in one way or another, an idea of womanhood haunts their creativity.<br> <br>What am I seeing? In this exhibition, Women, which includes only paintings of women by the three artists, I am seeing images of one woman after another by artists who must be called Modernists and whose depictions of the human figure were no longer constrained by classical notions of resemblance and naturalism. For all three painters, &#x201c;woman&#x201d; seems to embrace much more than the definition in Webster&#x2019;s: &#x201c;an adult human female.&#x201d; In The Second Sex, Simone de Beauvoir argued that one is not born a woman but becomes a woman. It is certainly true that meanings of the word accumulate and change even over the course of a single lifetime. Since the 1950s, a distinction between sex and gender has emerged. The former is a marker of female and male biological bodies and the latter socially constructed ideas of femininity and masculinity that vary with time and culture, but even this division has become theoretically perplexing.<br> <br>We have no recourse to living bodies in art. I am looking into fictive spaces. Hearts are not pumping. Blood is not running. The markers of the human female in biology&#x2014;breasts and genitalia that I see in these images (when I see them)&#x2014;are representations. Pregnancy and birth do not figure explicitly in these pictures, but sometimes what is not there is powerful nevertheless. I am looking at inhabitants of the world of the imaginary, of play, and of fantasy made by painters who are now dead, but who were all making art in the twentieth century. Only the signs of the artist&#x2019;s bodily gestures remain: the traces left by an arm that once moved violently or cautiously in space, a head and torso that leaned forward, then back, feet planted beside each other or at an angle, and eyes that took in what was there and what was not yet there on the canvas, and the feelings and thoughts that guided the brush, that revised, altered, and established the rhythms of motion, which I feel in my own body as I look at the pictures. The visual is also tactile and motoric.<br> <br>I do not see myself as I look at a painting. I see the imaginary person in the canvas. I haven&#x2019;t disappeared from myself. I am aware of my feelings&#x2014;my awe, irritation, distress, and admiration&#x2014;but for the time being my perception is filled up by the painted person. She is of me while I look and, later, she is of me when I remember her. In memory, she may not be exactly as she is when I stand directly in front of the painting but rather some version of her that I carry in my mind. While I am perceiving her, I establish a relation to this imaginary woman, to Picasso&#x2019;s Weeping Woman, to Beckmann&#x2019;s masked Columbine, to de Kooning&#x2019;s goofy monster, Woman II. I animate them, as do you. Without a viewer, a reader, a listener, art is dead. Something happens between me and it, an &#x201c;it&#x201d; that carries in itself another person&#x2019;s willed act, a thing suffused with another person&#x2019;s subjectivity, and in it I may feel pain, humor, sexual desire, discomfort. And that is why I don&#x2019;t treat artworks as I would treat a chair, but I don&#x2019;t treat them as a real person either.<br> <br>A work of art has no sex.<br> <br>The sex of the artist does not determine a work&#x2019;s gender, which may be one or another, or multiple versions thereof.<br> <br>Who are the female figments of these artists, and how do I perceive them?<br> <br>My perception of the three canvases is not exclusively visual or even purely sensory. Emotion is always part of perception, not distinct from it.<br> <br>Emotion and art have had a long and uneasy relation ever since Plato banned poets from his republic. Philosophers and scientists are still arguing over what emotion or affects are and how they work, but a stubborn sense of emotion as dangerous, as something that must be controlled, put down, and subjugated to reason has remained a part of Western culture. Most art historians are similarly queasy about emotion and instead write about form, color, influences, or historical context. Feeling, however, is not only unavoidable; it is crucial to understanding a work of art. Indeed, an artwork becomes senseless without it. In a letter to a friend, Henry James wrote, &#x201c;In the arts feeling is always meaning.&#x201d;4 In his book on his fellow art historian Aby Warburg, E. H. Gombrich quotes Warburg: &#x201c;Moreover, I have acquired an honest disgust of the aestheticizing of art history. The formal approach to the image devoid of understanding of its biological necessity as a product between religion and art . . . appeared to me to lead merely to barren word mongering.&#x201d;5 The German word Einf�hlung was first introduced by Robert Vischer in 1873 as an aesthetic term, a way of feeling oneself into a work of art, a word that through various historical convolutions would become &#x201c;empathy&#x201d; in English. Contemporary neurobiological research on emotion is attempting to parse the complex affective processes at work in visual perception. As Mariann Weierich and Lisa Feldman Barrett write in &#x201c;Affect as a Source of Visual Attention,&#x201d; &#x201c;People don&#x2019;t come to know the world exclusively through their senses; rather, their affective states influence the processing of sensory stimulation from the very moment an object is encountered.&#x201d;6 A vital aspect of any object&#x2019;s meaning resides in the feelings it evokes of pleasure, distress, admiration, confusion. For example, depending on its emotional importance or salience, a viewer may perceive an object as closer or more distant. And this psychobiological feeling is a creature of the past, of expectation, of having learned to read the world. In this neurobiological model what is learned&#x2014;feelings in relation to people and objects and the language we use to express them&#x2014;become body, are of bodies. The mental does not hover over the physical as a Cartesian ghost.<br> She Is Sobbing<p></p> <br>I look at Picasso&#x2019;s Weeping Woman, and before I have time to analyze what I am seeing, to speak of color or form or gesture or style, I have registered the face, hand, and part of a torso on the canvas and have an immediate emotional response to the image. The picture upsets me. I feel a tension in the corners of my own mouth. I want to continue looking, but I am also repelled by this figure. Although I am looking at a person crying, I find the depiction cruel. What is happening?<br> <br>The face is the locus of identity&#x2014;the place on the body to which we give our attention. We do not recognize people by their hands and feet, even those intimate to us. Infants only hours old can imitate the facial expressions of adults, although they do not know what or whom they are looking at and will not be able to recognize their own images in the mirror for many months to come. Babies seem to have a visual-motor-sensory awareness of the other person&#x2019;s face, what some researchers have called a &#x201c;like-me&#x201d; response that results in imitation, also referred to as &#x201c;primary intersubjectivity.&#x201d; A friend of mine, the philosopher Maria Brincker, who is working on theories of mirroring, was musing aloud to her six-year-old daughter, Oona, about infant imitation.<br> <br>&#x201c;A tiny child can imitate my expressions,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that hard to understand?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, Mom,&#x201d; said Oona. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s easy. The baby has your face.&#x201d;<br> <br>To some degree at least, while we are looking at someone in life, in a photograph, or in a painting, we have her face. The face we perceive supplants our own. Maurice Merleau-Ponty understood this as human intercorporeality, which is not gained through self-conscious analogy but is immediately present in our perception.7 Exactly when gender recognition comes about in development is not clear, although research seems to show an ability in infants only six months old to distinguish between male and female faces and voices.8 Of course, there are also many nonessential cues&#x2014;length of hair, dress, makeup, etc. But my apprehension and reading of Picasso&#x2019;s canvas participates in a dyadic reality, my I and the you of the canvas. The figure before me is not naturalistic. How do I even know it&#x2019;s a woman? I read her hair, her eyelashes, the scallops of her handkerchief, the rounded line of one visible breast as feminine. The weeping woman is only paint, and yet the corners of my mouth move as a motor-sensory echo of the face before me.<br> <br>The weeping woman is an image of wholly externalized grief. Compare this canvas to the neoclassical painting from 1923 of Picasso&#x2019;s first wife, Olga Khokhlova, which conveys the stillness of a statue, a serene object that nevertheless seems to harbor a hidden interiority and the suggestion of thoughtfulness, or to Nude Standing by the Sea (1929), in which recognition of this comical thing as person relies on the suggestion of legs, arms, and buttocks. Two absurd cones&#x2014;allusions to breasts&#x2014;inscribe its femininity, as does its posture&#x2014;odalisque-like, an Ingres nude turned grotesque. No measuring of limbs necessary. In the former, the illusion of realism allows me to project an inner life onto the representation, what Warburg called &#x201c;mimetic intensification as subjective action.&#x201d;9 In the latter, no such projection is possible. The &#x201c;like-me&#x201d; exchange is fundamentally disturbed. This person-thing is a not-I.<br> <br>My feeling for the weeping woman is more complex, somewhere between subjective engagement and objectifying distance. The perspective of the woman&#x2019;s face is wrenched. I see a nose and agonized mouth in profile, but with both eyes and both nostrils also in view, which creates the paradox of a paralyzed shudder&#x2014;the heaving motion of sobs as a head moves back and forth. The tears are mapped as two black lines with small bulbous circles beneath. The violet, blues, and somber browns and blacks are the culturally coded colors of sorrow in the West. We sing the blues and wear black for mourning. And the handkerchief she holds to her face evokes a waterfall. The black lines of its folds remind me of more tears, a torrent of tears. But she is also an alien. The visible hand she holds out, with its thumb and two fingers, has nails that resemble both knives and talons. There is a dangerous quality to this grief, as well as something faintly ridiculous. Notice: her ear is on backward.<br> <br>Art history always tells a story. The question is: How to tell the story? And how does telling the story affect my looking at and reading of the painting?<br> The Story of the Girls<p></p> <br>I know that I am looking at a picture of Dora Maar, the artist and intellectual, whose haunting photographs are among my favorite Surrealist images. Her extraordinary photo P�re Ubu, which was included in the London International Surrealist Exhibition in 1936, embodies for me the very idea of the gentle monster. I know, too, that she had an affair with Picasso and that the standard Picasso narrative now includes the women with whom he was sexually involved, often called his &#x201c;muses,&#x201d; part of the canon of Picasso&#x2019;s periods and styles. Over and over, he depicted an artist before his easel, brush in hand, with a naked woman as model. Picasso&#x2019;s link between sexual desire and art is obsessively presented in the work itself.<br> <br>In the Picasso literature, which is vast, these women are almost always referred to by their first names: Fernande, Olga, Marie-Th�r�se, Dora, etc. The art historians and biographers have appropriated the artist&#x2019;s intimacy with them, but the painter is rarely, if ever, Pablo, unless the reference is to him as a child&#x2014;a small but telling sign of the condescension inherent in this art historical framing of a life&#x2019;s work. John Richardson is exemplary. In his three-volume biography of Picasso, the women in the artist&#x2019;s life all go by first names. And Gertrude Stein, the great American writer and friend, but not lover, of Picasso, is repeatedly called &#x201c;Gertrude.&#x201d;10 Intimate male friends (famous or obscure) always merit surnames. I am fascinated that no one I have read seems to have noticed that the literature on Picasso continually turns grown-up women into girls.<br> The War Story<p></p> <br>Picasso painted Maar as a weeper several times in 1937, the year of the April bombing of the Basque region Guernica in Spain, an event that prompted Picasso&#x2019;s harrowing painting by the same name. The canvases of the weeping women are therefore often read as part of an outraged response to the Spanish Civil War. She also did the series of photographs documenting the progress of the work.<br> The Cruel Love Story<p></p> <br>According to Fran�oise Gilot, Picasso described Maar&#x2019;s image as an inner vision. &#x201c;For me she is the weeping woman. For years I&#x2019;ve painted her in tortured forms, not through sadism, not through pleasure, either; just obeying a vision that forced itself on me. It was the deep reality, not the superficial one.&#x201d;11 During one of Maar&#x2019;s early encounters with Picasso, he watched her play the knife game at a caf�, repeatedly stabbing the spaces between her splayed fingers. Inevitably she missed, cut herself, and bled. As the story goes, Picasso asked for the gloves she had removed and displayed them in a vitrine in his apartment. In 1936, he drew Maar as a beautiful harpy, her head on a bird&#x2019;s body. Picasso&#x2019;s biographers have cast their subject&#x2019;s misogyny and sadism in various lights, but none of them doubts that his fear, cruelty, and ambivalence found their way onto his canvases. Perhaps this was most succinctly stated by Angela Carter: &#x201c;Picasso liked cutting up women.&#x201d;12<br> <br>The tearful woman with her weapon-like fingernails clearly has multiple dream-like associations: war, grief, sadistic pleasure. They are all there in the weeping woman.<br> <br>Ideas become part of our perceptions, but we are not always conscious of them.<br> <br>The story of art is continually being revised by art movements, by money and collectors, by &#x201c;definitive&#x201d; museum shows, by new concerns, discoveries, and ideologies that alter the telling of the past. Every story yokes together disparate elements in time, and every story, by its very nature, leaps over a lot.<br> The Grand Narrative of Modernism and Its Kinks<p></p> <br>The name &#x201c;Picasso&#x201d; is instantly recognizable to many people all over the world as a sign of modern art. &#x201c;Picasso&#x201d; has come to signify a heroic myth of greatness&#x2014;an agonistic narrative of influences and stylistic revolutions&#x2014;that coincides with a sequence of women and their consequent ouster from favor: Picasso as Henry VIII. Willem de Kooning called Picasso &#x201c;the man to beat,&#x201d; as if art were a fistfight, a fitting metaphor in the New Yo...</p><h2>Designs and Patterns for Embroiderers and Craftspeople (Dover Pictorial Archive)</h2><p><p>Have you ever wanted to create your own embroidery and crewel designs but given up the idea just because you can't draw?

Pauli was fascinated by the inner reaches of his own psyche and not afraid to dabble in the occult, while Jung looked to science for answers to the psychological questions that tormented him. Their rich friendship led them, in Jung&#x2019;s words, into &#x201c;the no-man&#x2019;s land between physics and the psychology of the unconscious . . . the most fascinating yet the darkest hunting ground of our times.&#x201d; Both were obsessed with the far-reaching significance of the number &#x201c;137&#x201d;&#x2015;a primal number that seemed to hint at the origins of the universe itself. Their quest to solve its enigma led them on a lifelong journey into the ancient secrets of alchemy, the work of Johannes Kepler, and the Chinese Book of Changes. This is the captivating story of an extraordinary and fruitful collaboration between two of the greatest thinkers of the twentieth century.66 illustrations</p><p><strong>Arthur I. Miller</strong> is professor emeritus at University College London. He has published many critically acclaimed books, including <em>Einstein</em>, <em>Picasso</em>, and writes for publications such as the <em>New York Times</em>. He lives in London.<br>The heart of this book lies not in the promised decipherment of the title but in Miller&#x2019;s excellent dual biography of two men who changed their fields. Physicist Pauli was a brilliant but unhappy womanizer when his life&#x2019;s disturbances led him to consult with Jung, famous for connecting psychology with spirituality. The relationship was a fruitful one on both sides, with Pauli making peace with his unsettled soul and continuing his groundbreaking theorizing, while Jung gained understanding of principles of contemporary physics that led, albeit circuitously, to his articulation of the idea of synchronicity, which he felt was one of his most important contributions. A series of Pauli&#x2019;s vivid dreams, together with Jung&#x2019;s analysis of them, forms an unexpectedly rich centerpiece of the book. And the cosmic number? A bit of bait-and-switch, that, as it is only briefly mentioned.

The facts of his life, known from surviving documents, are sparse. He was one of eight children born to John Shakespeare, a merchant of some standing in his community. William probably went to the King&#x2019;s New School in Stratford, but he had no university education. In November 1582, at the age of eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway, eight years his senior, who was pregnant with their first child, Susanna. She was born on May 26, 1583. Twins, a boy, Hamnet ( who would die at age eleven), and a girl, Judith, were born in 1585. By 1592 Shakespeare had gone to London working as an actor and already known as a playwright. A rival dramatist, Robert Greene, referred to him as &#x201c;an upstart crow, beautified with our feathers.&#x201d; Shakespeare became a principal shareholder and playwright of the successful acting troupe, the Lord Chamberlain&#x2019;s Men (later under James I, called the King&#x2019;s Men). In 1599 the Lord Chamberlain&#x2019;s Men built and occupied the Globe Theater in Southwark near the Thames River. Here many of Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays were performed by the most famous actors of his time, including Richard Burbage, Will Kempe, and Robert Armin. In addition to his 37 plays, Shakespeare had a hand in others, including <i>Sir Thomas More</i> and <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>, and he wrote poems, including <i>Venus and Adonis</i> and <i>The Rape of Lucrece</i>. His 154 sonnets were published, probably without his authorization, in 1609. In 1611 or 1612 he gave up his lodgings in London and devoted more and more time to retirement in Stratford, though he continued writing such plays as <b>The Tempest</b> and <b>Henry VII</b> until about 1613. He died on April 23 1616, and was buried in Holy Trinity Church, Stratford. No collected edition of his plays was published during his life-time, but in 1623 two members of his acting company, John Heminges and Henry Condell, put together the great collection now called the First Folio.introduction<br> Shakespeare creates in The Tempest a world of the imagination, a place of conflict and ultimately of magical rejuvenation, like the forests of A Midsummer Night&#x2019;s Dream and As You Like It. The journey to Shakespeare&#x2019;s island is to a realm of art where everything is controlled by the artist figure. Yet the journey is no escape from reality, for the island shows people what they are, as well as what they ought to be. Even its location juxtaposes the &#x201c;real&#x201d; world with an idealized landscape: like Plato&#x2019;s New Atlantis or Thomas More&#x2019;s Utopia, Shakespeare&#x2019;s island is to be found both somewhere and nowhere. On the narrative level, it is located in the Mediterranean Sea. Yet there are overtones of the New World, the Western Hemisphere, where Thomas More had situated his island of Utopia. Ariel fetches dew at Prospero&#x2019;s command from the &#x201c;Bermudas&#x201d; (1.2.230). Caliban when prostrate reminds Trinculo of a &#x201c;dead Indian&#x201d; (2.2.33) who might be displayed before gullible crowds eager to see such a prodigious creature from across the seas, and Caliban&#x2019;s god, Setebos, was, according to Richard Eden&#x2019;s account of Magellan&#x2019;s circumnavigation of the globe (in History of Travel, 1577), worshiped by South American natives. An inspiration for Shakespeare&#x2019;s story (for which no direct literary source is known) may well have been various accounts of the shipwreck in the Bermudas in 1609 of the Sea Venture, which was carrying settlers to the new Virginian colony. Shakespeare borrowed details from Sylvester Jourdain&#x2019;s A Discovery of the Bermudas, Otherwise Called the Isle of Devils, published in 1610, and from William Strachey&#x2019;s A True Reportory of the Wreck and Redemption . . . from the Islands of the Bermudas, which Shakespeare must have seen in manuscript since it was not published until after his death. He wrote the play shortly after reading these works, for The Tempest was acted at court in 1611. He may also have known or heard of various accounts of Magellan&#x2019;s circumnavigation of the world in 1519&#x2013;1522 (including Richard Eden&#x2019;s shortened English version, as part of his History of Travel, of an Italian narrative by Antonio Pigafetta), Francis Fletcher&#x2019;s journal of Sir Francis Drake&#x2019;s circumnavigation in 1577&#x2013;1580, Richard Rich&#x2019;s News from Virginia (1610), and still other potential sources of information. Shakespeare&#x2019;s fascination with the Western Hemisphere gave him, not the actual location of his story, which remains Mediterranean, but a state of mind associated with newness and the unfamiliar. From this strange and unknown place, we gain a radical perspective on the old world of European culture. Miranda sees on the island a &#x201c;new world&#x201d; in which humankind appears &#x201c;brave&#x201d; (5.1.185), and, although her wonder must be tempered by Prospero&#x2019;s rejoinder that &#x201c; &#x2019;Tis new to thee&#x201d; (line 186) and by Aldous Huxley&#x2019;s still more ironic use of her phrase in the title of his satirical novel Brave New World, the island endures as a restorative vision. Even though we experience it fleetingly, as in a dream, this nonexistent realm assumes a permanence enjoyed by all great works of art.<br><br> Prospero rules autocratically as artist-king and patriarch over this imaginary world, conjuring up trials and visions to test people&#x2019;s intentions and awaken their consciences. To the island come an assortment of persons who, because they require varied ordeals, are separated by Prospero and Ariel into three groups: King Alonso and those accompanying him; Alonso&#x2019;s son, Ferdinand; and Stephano and Trinculo. Prospero&#x2019;s authority over them, though strong, has limits. As Duke of Milan, he was bookishly inattentive to political matters and thus vulnerable to the Machiavellian conniving of his younger brother, Antonio. Only in this world apart, the artist&#x2019;s world, do his powers derived from learning find their proper sphere. Because he cannot control the world beyond his isle, he must wait for &#x201c;strange, bountiful Fortune, / Now my dear lady&#x201d; (1.2.179&#x2013;80) to bring his enemies near his shore. He eschews, moreover, the black arts of diabolism. His is a white magic, devoted ultimately to what he considers moral ends: rescuing Ariel from the spell of the witch Sycorax, curbing the appetite of Caliban, spying on Antonio and Sebastian in the role of Conscience. He thus comes to see Fortune&#x2019;s gift of delivering his enemies into his hands as an opportunity for him to forgive and restore them, not be revenged.<br><br> Such an assumption of godlike power is close to arrogance, even blasphemy, for Prospero is no god. His chief power, learned from books and exercised through Ariel, is to control the elements so as to create illusion&#x2014;of separation, of death, of the gods&#x2019; blessing. Yet, since he is human, even this power is an immense burden and temptation. Prospero has much to learn, like those whom he controls. He must subdue his anger, his self-pity, his readiness to blame others, his domineering over Miranda. He must overcome the vengeful impulse he experiences toward those who have wronged him, and he must conquer the longing many a father feels to hold on to his daughter when she is desired by another man. He struggles with these problems through his art, devising games and shows in which his angry self-pity and jealousy are transmuted into playacting scenes of divine warning and forgiveness toward his enemies and watchful parental austerity toward Miranda and Ferdinand. Prospero&#x2019;s responsibilities cause him to behave magisterially and to be resented by the spirits of the isle. His authority is problematic to us because he seems so patriarchal, colonialist, even sexist and racist in his arrogating to himself the right and responsibility to control others in the name of values they may not share. Ariel longs to be free of this authority. Perhaps our sympathy for Prospero is greatest when we perceive that he, too, with mixed feelings of genuine relief and melancholy, is ready to lay aside his demanding and self-important role as creative moral intelligence.<br><br> Alonso and his court party variously illustrate the unre- generate world left behind in Naples and Milan. We first see them on shipboard, panicky and desperate, their titles and fi- nery mocked by roaring waves. Futile ambition seems destined for a watery demise. Yet death by water in this play is a trans- figuration rather than an end, a mystical rebirth, as in the re- generative cycle of the seasons from winter to summer. Ariel suggests as much in his song about a drowned father: &#x201c;Those are pearls that were his eyes. / Nothing of him that doth fade / But doth suffer a sea change / Into something rich and strange&#x201d; (1.2.402&#x2013;5). Still, this miracle is not apparent at first to those who are caught in the illusion of death. As in T. S. Eliot&#x2019;s The Waste Land, which repeatedly alludes to The Tempest, self-blinded human beings fear a disaster that is ironically the prelude to reawakening.<br><br> The illusions created on the island serve to test these imperfect men and to make them reveal their true selves. Only Gonzalo, who long ago aided Prospero and Miranda when they were banished from Milan, responds affirmatively to illusion. In his eyes, their having been saved from drowning is a miracle: they breathe fresh air, the grass is green on the island, and their very garments appear not to have been stained by the salt water. His ideal commonwealth (2.1.150&#x2013;71), which Shakespeare drew in part from an essay by Montaigne, postulates a natural goodness in humanity and makes no allowance for the darker propensities of human behavior, but at least Gonzalo&#x2019;s cheerfulness is in refreshing contrast to the jaded sneers of some of his companions. Sebastian and Antonio react to the magic isle, as to Gonzalo&#x2019;s commonwealth, by cynically refusing to believe in miracles. They scoff at Gonzalo for insistently looking on the bright side; if he were to examine his supposedly unstained clothes more carefully, they jest, he would discover that his pockets are filled with mud. Confident that they are unobserved, they seize the opportunity afforded by Alonso&#x2019;s being asleep to plot a murder and political coup. This attempt is not only despicable but also madly ludicrous, for they are all shipwrecked and no longer have kingdoms over which to quarrel. Even more ironically, Sebastian and Antonio, despite their insolent belief in their self-sufficiency, are being observed. The villains must be taught that an unseen power keeps track of their misdeeds. However presumptuous Prospero may be to assume through Ariel&#x2019;s means the role of godlike observer, he does awaken conscience and prevent murder. The villains may revert to type when returned to their usual habitat, but even they are at least briefly moved to an awareness of the unseen (3.3.21&#x2013;7). Alonso, more worthy than they, though burdened, too, with sin, responds to his situation with guilt and despair, for he assumes that his son Ferdinand&#x2019;s death is the just punishment of the gods for Alonso&#x2019;s part in the earlier overthrow of Prospero. Alonso must be led, by means of curative illusions, through the purgative experience of contrition to the reward he thinks impossible and undeserved: reunion with his lost son.<br><br> Alonso is thus, like Posthumus in Cymbeline or Leontes in The Winter&#x2019;s Tale, a tragicomic figure&#x2014;sinful, contrite, forgiven. Alonso&#x2019;s son Ferdinand must also undergo ordeals and visions devised by Prospero to test his worth, but more on the level of romantic comedy. Ferdinand is young, innocent, and hopeful, well matched to Miranda. From the start, Prospero obviously approves of his prospective son-in-law. Yet even Prospero, needing to prepare himself for a life in which Miranda will no longer be solely his, is not ready to lay aside at least the comic fiction of parental opposition. He invents difficulties, imposes tasks of logbearing (like those assigned Caliban), and issues stern warnings against premarital lust. In the comic mode, parents are expected to cross their children in matters of the heart. Prospero is so convincing in his role of overbearing parent, insisting on absolute unthinking obedience from his daughter, that we remain unsure whether he is truly like that or whether we are meant to sense in his performance a grappling with his own deepest feelings of possessiveness and autocratic authority, tempered finally by his awareness of the arbitrariness of such a role and his readiness to let Miranda decide for herself. As a teacher of youth, moreover, Prospero is convinced by long experience that prizes too easily won are too lightly esteemed. Manifold are the temptations urging Ferdinand to surrender to the natural rhythms of the isle as Caliban would. In place of ceremonies conducted in civilized societies by the church, Prospero must create the illusion of cere- mony by his art. The betrothal of Ferdinand and Miranda accordingly unites the best of both worlds: the natural innocence of the island, which teaches them to avoid the corruptions of civilization at its worst, and the higher law of nature achieved through moral wisdom at its best. To this marriage, the goddesses Iris, Ceres, and Juno bring promises of bounteous harvest, &#x201c;refreshing showers,&#x201d; celestial harmony, and a springtime brought back to the earth by Proserpina&#x2019;s return from Hades (4.1.76&#x2013;117). In Ferdinand and Miranda, &#x201c;nurture&#x201d; is wedded to &#x201c;nature.&#x201d; This bond unites spirit and flesh, legitimizing erotic pleasure by incorporating it within Prospero&#x2019;s vision of a cosmic moral order.<br><br> At the lowest level of this traditional cosmic and moral framework, in Prospero&#x2019;s view, are Stephano and Trinculo. Their comic scenes juxtapose them with Caliban, for he represents untutored Nature, whereas they represent the unnatural depths to which human beings brought up in civilized society can fall. In this they resemble Sebastian and Antonio, who have learned in supposedly civilized Italy arts of intrigue and political murder. The antics of Stephano and Trinculo burlesque the conduct of their presumed betters, thereby exposing to ridicule the self-deceptions of ambitious men. The clowns desire to exploit the natural wonders of the isle by taking Caliban back to civilization to be shown in carnivals or by plying him with strong drink and whetting his resentment against authority. These plottings are in vain, however, for, like Sebastian and Antonio, the clowns are being watched. The clowns teach Caliban to cry out for &#x201c;freedom&#x201d; (2.2.184), by which they mean license to do as one pleases, but are foiled by Ariel as comic nemesis. Because they are degenerate buffoons, Prospero as satirist devises for them an exposure that is appropriately humiliating and satirical.<br><br> In contrast with them, Caliban is in many ways a sympathetic character. His sensitivity to natural beauty, as in his descriptions of the &#x201c;nimble marmoset&#x201d; or the dreaming music he so often hears (2.2.168; 3.2.137&#x2013;45), is entirely appropriate to this child of nature. He is, to be sure, the child of a witch and is called many harsh names by Miranda and Prospero, such as &#x201c;Abhorr�d slave&#x201d; and &#x201c;a born devil, on whose nature / Nurture can never stick&#x201d; (1.2.354; 4.1.188&#x2013;9). Yet he protests with some justification that the island was his in the first place and that Prospero and Miranda are interlopers. His very existence calls radically into question the value of civilization, which has shown itself capable of limitless depravity. What profit has Caliban derived from learning Prospero&#x2019;s language other than, as he puts it, to &#x201c;know how to curse&#x201d; (1.2.367)? With instinctive cunning, he senses that books are his chief enemy and plots to destroy them first in his attempt at rebellion. The unspoiled natural world does indeed offer civilization a unique perspective on itself. In this it resembles Gonzalo&#x2019;s ideal commonwealth, which, no matter how laughably implausible from the cynic&#x2019;s point of view, does at least question some assumptions&#x2014;economic, political, and social&#x2014;common in Western societies.<br><br> Radical perspectives of this kind invite consideration of many unsettling questions about exploration, colonialist empire building, and sexual imperialism. The fleeting comparison of Caliban to an indigenous native (2.2.33), although ignored in stage productions of the play until the late nineteenth century, suggests a discourse on colonialism in The Tempest that anticipates to a remarkable degree a doleful history of exploitation, of providing rum and guns to the natives, and of taking away land through violent expropriation in the name of bringing civilization and God to the New World. Stephano and Trinculo, pouring wine down Caliban&#x2019;s throat and thus reducing him to a worshiping slave, show exploitation at its worst, but surely the play allows us to wonder also if Prospero&#x2019;s enslavement of Caliban, however high-minded in its claims of preventing disorder and rape, is not tainted by the same imperatives of possession and control. The issue is wonderfully complex. Caliban is a projection of both the naturally depraved savage described in many explorers&#x2019; accounts and the nobly innocent savage described by Montaigne. By dramatizing the conflict without taking sides, Shakespeare leaves open a debate about the worth of Prospero&#x2019;s endeavor to contain Caliban&#x2019;s otherness and produces an ambivalent result in which the apparent victory of colonialism and censorship does not entirely conceal the contradictory struggle through which those values are imposed. The play&#x2019;s many open-ended questions apply not only to the New World but also, nearer at hand, to Ireland&#x2014;an island on the margins of Britain that was regarded as both savage and threatening.<br><br> The play&#x2019;s discourse also raises issues of class and political justice. The battle between Prospero and Caliban is one of &#x201c;master&#x201d; and &#x201c;man&#x201d; (2.2.183); even if Caliban&#x2019;s cry of &#x201c;freedom&#x201d; leads him only into further enslavement by Stephano and Trinculo (who are themselves master...</p><h2>Later novels and stories : the Cha&#x302;teau ; So long, see you tomorrow ; stories and improvisations, 1957-1999</h2><p>On the centennial of William Maxwell's birth, here is the second volume in a two- volume collected edition that reveals the full range of an extraordinary literary voice, a voice that John Updike has called "one of the wisest in American fiction . . . as well as one of the kindest."

It bridges the gap between the natural sciences and music theory and, nearly a century after its first publication, it is still a standard text for the study of physiological acoustics &#x2014; the scientific basis of musical theory. It is also a treasury of knowledge for musicians and students of music and a major work in the realm of aesthetics, making important contributions to physics, anatomy, and physiology in its establishment of the physical theory of music. Difficult scientific concepts are explained simply and easily for the general reader.<br>The first two parts of this book deal with the physics and physiology of music. Part I explains the sensation of sound in general, vibrations, sympathetic resonances, and other phenomena.

After a survey of the different principles of musical styles in history (tonal systems of Pythagoras, the Church, the Chinese, Arabs, Persians, and others), he makes a detailed study of our own tonal system (keys, discords, progression of parts).<br>Important points in this 576-page work are profusely illustrated with graphs, diagrams, tables, and musical examples. 33 appendices discuss pitch, acoustics, and music, and include a very valuable table and study of the history of pitch in Europe from the fourteenth to the nineteenth centuries.<br></p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Stephen Biesty&#39;s Incredible Explosions: Exploded Views of Astonishing Things</h2><p>Twelve novel subjects--including the Grand Canyon and a city block--are presented from different points of view, in exploded illustrations, in detailed cross-sections, and even turned inside out, all complete with intriguing anecdotes.</p><p>Don't let the title mislead you--this book isn't about things that blow up like volcanoes or chemistry experiments gone awry. Instead, illustrator Stephen Biesty and author Richard Platt (<i>Stephen Biesty's Cross-Sections Castle</i>, <i>Stephen Beisty's Incredible Body</i>) have once again blown the cover off places as big as Venice and as off-limits as a Space Station so that young ones can see what's inside. This talented duo knows exactly what interests children. For example, at the Space Station young readers get to see cool stuff like cockpit controls and the module where space experiments are performed, as well as gross stuff like what happens to an astronaut with space sickness. Looking inside a movie studio, kids can peek at the makeup and hairstyling rooms (where glamour gals and demon monsters come to life) as well as an ocean liner in a huge water tank that's being attacked by a remote-control giant squid. With so much of the big world remaining hidden or inaccessible to children, fact-filled books such as these are instantly fascinating, fun, and even (sneakily) educational. (Ages 7 and older) <i>--Gail Hudson</i>Stephen Biesty is an artist of phenomenal talent with remarkable visual skills. As a child he spent hours drawing castles, knights at battle, and ferocious Vikings, taking inspiration from films such as Spartacus, Ben Hur, and Anthony and Cleopatra, which fueled his already fertile imagination. <p>In 1980, he attended Brighton Polytechnic where he specialized in historical reconstruction illustration and developed a particular interest in what went on inside castles and other ancient buildings. After graduating from Brighton with a BA in Graphic Design, Stephen earned an MA in Graphic Design at City of Birmingham Polytechnic working further in historical reconstruction. </p><p>Stephen became a full-time illustrator in 1985 and has since worked on a variety of information books for adults and children. It took Stephen two and a half years to draw the wonderful illustrations for the best-selling Stephen Biesty's Incredible Cross-Sections, which was published in 1992. That volume was the inspiration for a new range of cross-section books which include Man-of-War (1993), Castle (1994), Incredible Pop-Up Cross-Sections (1995), Incredible Explosions (1996), Incredible Everything (1997), Incredible Body (1998), and DK Amazing Pop-Up 3D Time Scape (1999). Stephen Biesty lives in Somerset, England with his wife and son.</p></p><h2>The Oxford Book of Aphorisms</h2><p>The dictionary defines "aphorism" as "a short pithy statement or maxim," but beneath this definition lies a wealth of wit and insight to which neither the word nor any brief description can do justice. This delightful anthology demonstrates just how rewarding the aphorism can be and how brilliantly the aphorist can illuminate a hidden truth or reveal the ironies of life.<br> Whatever the situation, whatever the mood, the reader will find in this international array of aphorisms just the right words to give his or her feeling pungent expression. The classic aphorists--La Bruy�re, Nietzsche, both Samuel Butlers, La Rochefoucault, Emerson--are here in abundance, as are the philosophers from the Greeks of Paul Val�ry, the social commentators from Edmund Burke to Walter Benjamin. Statesmen and scientists, Olympians and gadflies, mystics and boulevardiers--this collection brings together the most diverse figures, drawing freely on ancients and moderns, on the widsom of East and West, juxtaposing viewpoints as different as those of Jean Cocteau and George Orwell, Ambrose Bierce and Marcus Aurelius, Lord Chesterfield and Elias Canetti. Profound, provocative, and vastly entertaining, <em>The Oxford Book of Aphorisms</em> will lure the reader back to its pages time and again. The book is fully indexed, and wherever possible, sources, dates, and complete names are supplied.</p><p><br><em>About the Editor</em>:<br><strong>John Gross</strong>, a writer for <em>The New York Times</em>, is the author of <em>The Rise and Fall of the Man of Letters.</em><br>`entertaining, thoughtful, splendidly varied' Kinglsey Amis<br><br>`And now, from the people who bring you the best anthologies, one of their best anthologies.'

This is also available on cassette.<p> In a preface to this novel, Dickens described David Copperfield as his &#x201c;favorite child,&#x201d; and the story has remained among the favorites of Dickens&#x2019; readers, too, with the characters of Betsy Trotwood, Mr. Pegotty, Uriah Heep, and Wilkins Micawber as well as David himself becoming part of the fabric of Western culture. This facsimile reprint is of the <em>Household Edition of the Works of Charles Dickens</em>, published in the 1870s; the edition makes the work available again in a form in which tens of thousands of Victorians read it&#x2015;in two-column format, interspersed with illustrations throughout. </p> <p> <em>David Copperfield</em> was originally published in nineteen monthly parts between May 1, 1849 and November 1, 1850.* Each part except the last was of roughly the same length; the final installment was approximately twice as long as the others (and sold for 2 shillings, twice the price of previous parts). For the original serial publication, as well as early publication in book form, <em>David Copperfield</em> was illustrated by Hablot Browne (more commonly known as &#x201c;Phiz&#x201d;). </p> <p> Shortly after Dickens&#x2019; death in 1870 the British publisher Chapman &amp; Hall began to issue the <em>Household Edition of the Works of Charles Dickens</em> (not to be confused with the American <em>Household Edition of the Works</em>, which appeared in the 1860s). The principal illustrator for the edition was Fred Barnard, and the Dalziel brothers (the leading wood-engravers of the time) created the engravings from Barnard&#x2019;s illustrations; they described <em>The Household Edition</em> as &#x201c;by far the most important commission ever placed in our hands by Messrs. Chapman &amp; Hall.&#x201d; Volumes in <em>The Household Edition</em> began to appear in 1871, and the series was completed in 1879. Dickens&#x2019; works appeared in a great many Victorian editions (including numerous pirated ones). Scholars have understandably paid most attention to the earliest publication in serial form; <em>The Household Edition</em> may well have been the most popular form in which the novel appeared, however; the plates for <em>The Household Edition</em> were widely used for other editions as well, and it is certainly arguable that more Victorian readers would have read Dickens&#x2019; novels in this form than in any other. In 1911 the populist bibliophile J.A. Hammerton described <em>The Household Edition</em> as &#x201c;the most important illustrated edition&#x201d; of Dickens&#x2019; works. </p> <p> This is one of a series from Broadview Press of facsimile editions&#x2015;editions that provide readers with a direct sense of these works as the Victorians themselves experienced them. </p> <p> The breaks were as follows: I &#x2013; May 1849 (chs. 1&#x2013;3); II &#x2013; June 1849 (chs. 4&#x2013;6); III &#x2013; July 1849 (chs. 7&#x2013;9); IV &#x2013; August 1849 (chs. 10&#x2013;12); V &#x2013; September 1849 (chs. 13&#x2013;15); VI &#x2013; October 1849 (chs. 16&#x2013;18); VII &#x2013; November 1849 (chs. 19&#x2013;21); VIII &#x2013; December 1849 (chs. 22&#x2013;24); IX &#x2013; January 1850 (chs. 25&#x2013;27); X &#x2013; February 1850 (chs. 28&#x2013;31); XI &#x2013; March 1850 (chs. 32&#x2013;34); XII &#x2013; April 1850 (chs. 35&#x2013;37); XIII &#x2013; May 1850 (chs. 38&#x2013;40); XIV &#x2013; June 1850 (chs. 41&#x2013;43); XV &#x2013; July 1850 (chs. 44&#x2013;46); XVI &#x2013; August 1850 (chs. 47&#x2013;50); XVII &#x2013; September 1850 (chs. 51&#x2013;53); XVIII &#x2013; October 1850 (chs. 54&#x2013;57); XIX-XX &#x2013; November 1850 (chs. 58&#x2013;64). </p></p><h2>All-American Paleo Table: Classic Homestyle Cooking from a Grain-Free Perspective</h2><p><p><b>Scrumptious Paleo Recipes for Traditional American Favorites</b></p><p>Celebrating the rich and diverse American food culture, Caroline Potter, food blogger and Nutritional Therapy Practitioner, presents an incredible collection of healthy and wholesome twists on classic American dishes to feed your family and friends throughout the year.

The book is distinct from most world history texts in three important ways. First, it explores the ways in which historians use and produce information. Each chapter delves deeply into one or two specific issues of historical inquiry related to the chapter theme, showing how new primary sources, methodologies, or intellectual trends have changed how we engage with the past. Second, it clearly explains the political, economic, and ideological concepts that students need to understand in order to compare events and trends across time and space. Finally, the chapters are organized around global historical themes, which are explored through an array of conceptual and comparative lenses. While the book chapters proceed chronologically, each chapter is written with some chronological overlap linking it to preceding and subsequent chapters. This strategy emphasizes the interconnectedness between the events and themes of one chapter and those of surrounding chapters. A companion website includes quiz questions and flash cards for each chapter and PowerPoint-based slides for instructors.</p><p><br><strong>James Carter </strong>is Professor of History at Saint Joseph's University. <br><br><strong>Richard Warren</strong> is Professor of History at Saint Joseph's University.<br><br>"<em>Forging the Modern World</em> is a concise and stimulating overview of major trends in world history, moving skillfully across the globe and punctuated by memorable anecdotes."--Kenneth Pomeranz, <em>University of Chicago</em><p></p><br>"<em>Forging the Modern World</em> is a very strong text.

Boards and books in very good condition. Enclosed in edge chipped slipcase.</p><p>In a stunning addition to the Anchor Bible Reference Library, Raymond E. Brown, the preeminent scriptural scholar who won great acclaim for his The Birth of the Messiah , now crowns a distinguished career with this much-awaited companion work. The biblical accounts in Matthew, Mark, Luke and John of the death of Jesus comprise, as Brown points out, ``the central narrative in the Christian story''; and the result of Brown's treatment of them here is an unprecedentedly complete but amazingly accessible exegesis of those four Gospels' passion narratives. Combining a lucid synthesis of the vast body of scholarly passion literature with his own insightful explanation of what the evangelists wrote, Brown breaks down the walls of theological density to recapture the full drama and meaning of Jesus' final days from his arrest to his execution and burial. While scholars may be staggered by Brown's exhaustively comprehensive bibliography and assured grasp of its contents, his introductory division of the passion's unfolding into four ``Acts'' and several ``Scenes'' will especially appeal to pastors and devout lay readers. Indeed, rarely has the gap between Christian scholars and the non-academic faithful been bridged more successfully than in this definitive masterpiece. <p></p><p>Copyright 1994 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>Brown ( The Birth of the Messiah , Doubleday, 1993, among many others) presents a detailed explanation of what the four evangelists "intended and conveyed" with their narratives of the passion and death of Jesus and "translates" the messages for modern readers. He assembles the four Gospel accounts into a unified story but maintains the distinctiveness of each account in the commentary. Brown has succeeded in producing a near oxymoron: a thorough survey of a huge mass of relevant scholarly literature that is accessible to the educated lay reader. Greek is transliterated and translated, procedures and terms are clearly explained, and the entire story is presented as a drama in four acts. While the book can be pleasurably read from start to finish, the organization and the indexes (not seen) make these volumes an easily used reference work.

Ross</h2><p>Many years before his death in 1948, legendary golf course architect Donald Ross wrote a book that was never published. Within the manuscript, Ross offered many of his thoughts on the game that he so dearly loved. In the mid-1990s, the book was miraculously rediscovered and published to great acclaim. <p><b><i>Golf Has Never Failed Me</i></b>is an insightful look at the game by one of its most famous and beloved people. And what may surprise you is that many of the astute observations that he made so long ago still hold true today.</p></p><p>Donald Ross, one of Scotland&#39;s great exports to America, has designed or remodeled some of the most magnificent and challenging courses on the planet. His commentaries on the rationale behind his architecture, penned before World War I but only recently rediscovered, present a continuous fairway of graceful and thoughtful insights into the game. Is there a golfer alive who can&#39;t make use of such gems as &#34;Holes should be trapped so that par golf depends upon skill rather than upon strength,&#34; or &#34;Hazards are placed so as to force a (golfer) to use judgment and to exercise mental control in making the correct shot&#34;?</p><h2>Gidget</h2><p><b>A surfing, boy-crazy teenager&nbsp;comes of age in the summer of 1957 in this classic novel that inspired both movies and television and created an American pop culture icon.<br><br></b>&#x201c;My English comp teacher Mr. Glicksberg says if you want to be a writer you have to&#x2014;quote&#x2014;sit on a window sill and get all pensive and stuff and jot down descriptions. Unquote Glicksberg! I don't know what kind of things he writes but I found my inspiration in Malibu with a radio, my best girlfriends, and absolutely zillions of boys for miles. I absolutely had to write everything down because I heard that when you get older you forget things, and I&#x2019;d be the most miserable woman in the world if I forgot all about Moondoggie and what happened this summer.

The guys call her Gidget&#x2014;short for girl midget.&nbsp;Based on the experiences of his own daughter, Frederick Kohner&#x2019;s trend-setting novel became an international sensation with an irrepressible heroine whose voice still echoes every thrill, every fear, and every hope that every teenager ever had about growing up.<br><br><b>Includes a Foreword by Kathy Kohner Zuckerman (aka the real Gidget)</b></p><p>If all American literature comes from <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>, all American surf culture comes from <i>Gidget</i>, the ostensible diary of Kathy Kohner, a teensy, gutsy teenage girl who crashed the all-male scene at Malibu Beach north of L.A. in 1957 and earned, from Moondoggie and others, the nickname Gidget, which meant "Girl Midget." Her father, the German immigrant screenwriter Frederick Kohner, fascinated by the beach-shack counterculture, interviewed his perky daughter at length, eavesdropped with permission on her phone calls, fictionalized her adventures, and batted out this influential bestseller. He nailed a tiny subculture's new form of speech ("If you want to know what goes on in Loveville ... Dig Number One: being gone on a boy is more important than having a boy gone on you.") and made it a pop-culture staple. Newly reissued with the real Gidget's picture on the cover (as on the original hardback), the book is very slim (appropriately enough) and historically beguiling.

For nearly 25 years, the multiple editions of Hackman and Johnson's outstanding work have been the backbone of leadership courses at hundreds of colleges and universities. The authors extend this tradition of excellence in the Sixth Edition, which continues to serve as a valuable catalyst for generating new insights, debating controversial issues, and contributing to the ongoing dialogue on leading and following.<p> Hackman and Johnson illuminate our understanding of leadership by approaching it as a communication-based activity. They artfully balance research and theory with practical, real-world suggestions for improving communication competence and leadership effectiveness in small-group, organizational, and public contexts. The comprehensive Sixth Edition adds discussions of organizational politics, project leadership, executive-level teams, adaptive leadership, intergroup leadership, sensemaking, and in-extremis leadership. Readers will also appreciate the expanded treatment of bad leadership, emotional competencies, followership styles, charisma, leader development, crisis leadership, and virtual team leadership. Case studies cover such timely issues as the pink slime controversy, the legacy of Steve Jobs, banning super-sized soft drinks, the scandal at Penn State University, and the Miracle on the Hudson.</p><p> Abundant examples, case studies, self-assessments, and research highlights enhance the presentation.

It takes the gardener through the beginning steps of identifying native plants, evaluating them in relation to conventional garden materials, and learning detailed techniques of propagation and culture. Annuals, perennials (including ferns), bulbs, shrubs and trees are included&#x2014;with about 350 species treated in detail, and many others included in charts and listings for quick reference.<br><br>A few California native plants have been in cultivation for a hundred years or so, but widespread consciousness of natives is relatively recent. It has arisen partly because of the recent drought, which natives survived more readily than exotics, and partly because of growing awareness that many natives have become rare or endangered, and may be preserved and perpetuated by cultivation for their ornamental qualities. The book is in full accord with the new trend in landscaping in which the environment, climate, and restricted water supplies are taken into account&#x2014;not only for gardens but also for parks, roadside plantings, and other large-scale landscaping.<br><br>Because propagation and cultural methods for many native plants have never been recorded, the author spent years gathering information through correspondence. She has also had personal experience in growing natives for more than 30 years. The result is the first complete, practical, convenient guide for growing native plants. It will be essential for the experienced gardener and the beginner alike.</p><p><b>Majorie G. Schmidt</b> has written a column on growing native plants for <i>Fremontia,</i> the journal of the California Native Plant Society, and has also contributed to many other horticultural journals."The author has selected the best candidates for the garden from the state flora and provides descriptions, cultural information and an estimate of the garden value for each species." -- <i>American Horticulturist</i></p><h2>Polio: An American Story</h2><p>All who lived in the early 1950s remember the fear of polio and the elation felt when a successful vaccine was found. Now David Oshinsky tells the gripping story of the polio terror and of the intense effort to find a cure, from the March of Dimes to the discovery of the Salk and Sabin vaccines--and beyond. Here is a remarkable portrait of America in the early 1950s, using the widespread panic over polio to shed light on our national obsessions and fears. Drawing on newly available papers of Jonas Salk, Albert Sabin and other key players, Oshinsky paints a suspenseful portrait of the race for the cure, weaving a dramatic tale centered on the furious rivalry between Salk and Sabin. Indeed, the competition was marked by a deep-seated ill will among the researchers that remained with them until their deaths. The author also tells the story of Isabel Morgan, perhaps the most talented of all polio researchers, who might have beaten Salk to the prize if she had not retired to raise a family. As backdrop to this feverish research, Oshinsky offers an insightful look at the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, which was founded in the 1930s by FDR and Basil O&#39;Connor. The National Foundation revolutionized fundraising and the perception of disease in America, using &#34;poster children&#34; and the famous March of Dimes to raise hundreds of millions of dollars from a vast army of contributors (instead of a few well-heeled benefactors), creating the largest research and rehabilitation network in the history of medicine. The polio experience also revolutionized the way in which the government licensed and tested new drugs before allowing them on the market, and the way in which the legal system dealt with manufacturers&#39; liability for unsafe products. Finally, and perhaps most tellingly, Oshinsky reveals that polio was never the raging epidemic portrayed by the media, but in truth a relatively uncommon disease. But in baby-booming America--increasingly suburban, family-oriented, and hygiene-obsessed--the specter of polio, like the specter of the atomic bomb, soon became a cloud of terror over daily life. Both a gripping scientific suspense story and a provocative social and cultural history, Polio opens a fresh window onto postwar America.</p><p><br>David M.

Macbeth has strong appeal for young audiences and Coville's lucid retelling captures much of it. Aided by the short, intense, and uninterrupted story line of the play, the reteller deftly weaves many of the most familiar quotes with his own dramatic narrative. In a short preface that sketches a quick history of the play's popularity, Coville invokes cultural literacy as one of his missions. Despite this heavy burden, he carries off the telling with grace. Kelley's dark, evocative pastels reflect and intensify the ominous mood. Glowering hillsides, gloomy interiors, the handsome and doomed Macbeths, and truly ghastly witches create a mood worthy of the play. The only unfortunate image is the weak-chinned Macbeth reacting to Banquo's ghost with a look more comic than horrified. Darkness prevails until the final painting of light morning skies over the hills. Coville's muscular sentences, full of dramatic word choices, make this a good read-aloud choice. While not avoiding the horrors in the story, the reteller does not dwell on the goriest moments, letting the worst, such as the slaughtering of Macduff's children, happen offstage. The accurate depiction of the story will give older students or casual playgoers a good quick review. If it doesn't end up lost among the picture books, this retelling could have many uses.?Sally Margolis, formerly at Deerfield Public Library, IL<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.Tempting readers into this dramatic retelling, the introduction calls this a ``horrific tale of witches, murder, ghosts and revenge.'' Coville (William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, 1996, etc.) repeats most of the play's famous phrases (condensing the ``Double double, toil and trouble'' incantation to six lines) and expertly captures the original's lurid supernatural manifestations and dark tone. Lady Macbeth's motives for murdering Duncan are never clear, and the porter's scene--along with some others--is dropped, so the plotting may be even patchier than Shakespeare's; still, as with Coville's previous adaptations of Shakespeare, children unfamiliar with the original will get a good idea of what awaits them. Kelley gives the entire cast a ghostly look in his shadowy, atmospheric paintings; except for the deliciously hideous Weird Sisters, figures are erect and dignified, generally posed at rest with eyes downcast or directed away from the viewer--and despite all the play's gory deeds, there is no blood to be seen. A volume for those who are certain that this kind of adaptation--reduces an intense psychological study to a slim story of multiple murders--will not prejudice children against future encounters with the Bard.

The Chinese poetic tradition is the largest and longest continuous tradition in world literature, and this rich and far-reaching anthology of nearly five hundred poems provides a comprehensive account of its first three millennia (1500 BCE to 1200 CE), the period during which virtually all its landmark developments took place. Unlike earlier anthologies of Chinese poetry, Hinton's book focuses on a relatively small number of poets, providing selections that are large enough to re-create each as a fully realized and unique voice. New introductions to each poet's work provide a readable history, told for the first time as a series of poetic innovations forged by a series of master poeets. From the classic texts of Chinese philosophy to intensely personal lyrics, from love poems to startling and strange perspectives on nature, Hinton has collected an entire world of beauty and insight. And in his eye-opening translations, these ancient poems feel remarkably fresh and contemporary, presenting a literature both radically new and entirely resonant.</p></p><p><p>David Hinton's translations of classical Chinese poetry have earned him a Guggenheim fellowship, numerous NEA and NEH fellowships, and both of the major awards given for poetry translation in the United States, the Harold Morton Landon Translation Award, from the Academy of American Poets, and the PEN Award for Poetry in Translation, from the PEN American Center. He is also the first translator in over a century to translate the four seminal works of Chinese philosophy: the <i>Tao Te Ching</i>, <i>Chuang Tzu</i>, <i>Analects</i>, and <i>Mencius</i>. He lives in Vermont.</p>THE BOOK OF SONGS <br>(c. 15th to 6th century B.C.E.) <br>THE EARLIEST GATHERING from China&#x2019;s oral tradition is The Book of Songs (Shih Ching), an anthology of 305 poems. This collection was compiled, according to cultural legend, by no less a figure than Confucius (551 to 479 B.C.E.), who selected the poems from a total of about 3,000 that had been gathered from China&#x2019;s various component states, each of which spoke its own dialect. The poems are traditionally dated between the twelfth and sixth centuries B.C.E., but any poem in the oral tradition evolves over time, and the origins of the earliest Shih Ching poems no doubt stretch back well beyond the twelfth century. The Songs can be seen as an epic of the Chinese people from the origins of China&#x2019;s earliest historical dynasty, the Shang (traditional dates 1766 to 1122 B.C.E.), to the unraveling of the Chou Dynasty (1122 to 221 B.C.E.) in Confucius&#x2019;s age, a span of time during which Chinese culture underwent a fundamental transformation from a spiritualized theocratic society to a secular humanist one. <br>Religious life in the Shang Dynasty focused on the worship of ancestors, and the Shang emperors ruled by virtue of a family lineage that connected them to Shang Ti, literally &#x201c;High Lord&#x201d; or &#x201c;Celestial Lord,&#x201d; a monotheistic god very like the Judeo-Christian god in that he created the universe and controlled all aspects of its historical process. In the mythological system that dominated Shang culture, the rulers were descended from Shang Ti and so could influence Shang Ti&#x2019;s shaping of events through their spirit-ancestors, thereby controlling all aspects of people&#x2019;s lives: weather, harvest, politics, economics, religion, and so on. Indeed, the Chinese people didn&#x2019;t experience themselves as substantially different from spirits, for the human realm was known as an extension of the spirit realm&#x2014;a situation very similar to the Judeo-Christian West, where people think of themselves as immortal souls, spirits only temporarily here in a material world before they move on to heaven, their true spirit-home. <br>Eventually the Shang rulers became cruel and tyrannical, much hated by their people, and they were overthrown by the Chou, a people living on the Shang border who had recently adopted Chinese culture. The Chou conquerors were faced with an obvious problem: if the Shang lineage descended directly from Shang Ti, and so had an absolute claim to rule Chinese society, how could the Chou justify replacing it, and how could they legitimize their rule in the eyes of the Shang people? Their solution was to reinvent Shang Ti in the form of Heaven, an impersonal divine power of the cosmos, thus ending the Shang&#x2019;s claim to legitimacy by lineage. The Chou rulers then proclaimed that the right to rule depended upon a &#x201c;Mandate of Heaven&#x201d;: once a ruler became unworthy, Heaven withdrew its Mandate and bestowed it on another. This concept was a major event in Chinese society: the first investment of power with an ethical imperative. <br>The early centuries of the Chou Dynasty appear to have fulfilled that imperative admirably. But the Chou eventually foundered because its rulers became increasingly tyrannical, and they lacked the Shang&#x2019;s absolute metaphysical source of legitimacy: if the Mandate could be transferred to them, it could obviously be transferred again. The rulers of the empire&#x2019;s component states grew increasingly powerful, claiming more and more sovereignty over their lands, until finally they were virtually independent nations. The final result of the Chou&#x2019;s &#x201c;metaphysical&#x201d; breakdown was, not surprisingly, all too physical: war. There was relentless fighting among the various states and frequent rebellion within them. This internal situation, so devastating to the people, continued to deteriorate after Confucius compiled the Shih Ching, until it finally led to the Chou&#x2019;s collapse two and a half centuries later. <br>By Confucius&#x2019;s time, the old social order had crumbled entirely, and China&#x2019;s intellectuals began struggling to create a new one. In the ruins of a grand monotheism that had dominated China for over a millennium, a situation not at all unlike that of the modern West, these thinkers created an earthly humanist culture: Confucius and Mencius crafting its political dimensions, Lao Tzu (see p. 36) and Chuang Tzu its spiritual dimensions. <br>This remarkable cultural transformation is reflected in the Songs. Although the situation was complex, with developments evolving differently in different regions and strata of society, the general movement appears to have been from poems of spiritualized power (ritual hymns and historical odes that celebrate the ruling class and its power) to secular folk-songs. The book&#x2019;s older hymns and odes tend to focus on the ruling class and its concerns: the historic and religious framework that legitimized the Shang and Chou rulers, the Chou overthrow of the Shang, and finally the Chou&#x2019;s rule. <br>Unfortunately, there is only a small group of five poems relating to the Shang Dynasty. They must have originated back in the Shang, eventually evolving into their Shih Ching forms, which were performed in a region of the Chou empire that maintained its connection to the Shang. With this one exception, the hymns and odes all relate to the Chou Dynasty. According to legend, a majority of them (nearly seventy) were written by the Duke of Chou, the last of the three revered rulers from the founding of the Chou, and the one credited with expanding and consolidating the Chou empire. He was also widely thought to have composed many of the folksongs (see Lu Yu&#x2019;s reference on p. 398). This is legend. The concept of a fixed written text composed by a particular individual did not exist at the time, so this attribution must have been invented much later, when that concept did exist. But as with so much of early Chinese culture, this legend became part of the reality upon which the culture was built, so the Duke of Chou might be considered China&#x2019;s first great poet. This remarkable figure is further credited with inventing the concept of the Mandate of Heaven, and so might also be considered the first of China&#x2019;s great philosophers. <br>It was the Duke of Chou&#x2019;s concept of a Mandate of Heaven that led to the most celebrated and enduring section of The Book of Songs: the later folk poetry that makes up nearly two-thirds of the collection. According to Chou ideology, Heaven bestowed its Mandate on a ruler only so long as that ruler successfully furthered the interests of the people, and it was thought that the best indication of the people&#x2019;s well-being was their poetry. So noble rulers would send officials out among the people to gather folk-songs in order to gauge how their policies were succeeding. These songs were translated from regional dialects into the standard literary language by government officials and performed with music at the court. It should, therefore, be remembered that this is not folk poetry itself, but folk poetry that was substantially reshaped by the poet-scholars who edited and translated it. <br>The organization of the Songs reflects China&#x2019;s overall cultural development, though in rough and reverse chronological order, beginning with the more recent folk-songs and ending with the ancient Shang hymns. The selection translated here is arranged chronologically, beginning with hymns and odes that move from Shang origins (pp. 9&#x2013;10) through the rise of the Chou people and their eventual overthrow of the Shang (pp. 11&#x2013;17), a period during which all cultural value was focused on the ruling class. It then continues through the troubled Chou, where the increasing value accorded the common people is reflected in the collection of folk-songs, with their quotidian themes and almost complete lack of Shang metaphysics. So at the end of this process, once the spiritualized social framework had been replaced by a secular humanist one, the poetry too had moved from religious hymns and historical odes celebrating the ruling class&#x2019;s interests to a plainspoken poetry of the common people. This latter poetry contains the two fundamental orientations that came to shape the Chinese poetic mainstream: it is a secular poetry having a direct personal voice speaking of immediate and concrete experience, and it is a poetry that functions as a window onto the inner life of a person. <br>DARK-ENIGMA BIRD <br>Heaven bade Dark-Enigma bird <br>descend and give birth to Shang, <br>our people inhabiting lands boundless and beyond, <br>then our Celestial Lord bade brave and forceful T&#x2019;ang <br>establish boundaries to the far corners of our lands, <br>bade him then rule these lands, <br>these nine regions in splendor. <br>So T&#x2019;ang, first emperor of Shang, <br>received the Mandate.

How? <br>She offered sacrifice, prayers <br>that she not be without child, <br>wandered the Lord&#x2019;s footprint, quickened <br>and conceived. She grew round, <br>dawn-life stirring there within, <br>she gave birth and she suckled, <br>and the child&#x2014;it was Millet God. <br>And so those months eased by <br>and the birth&#x2014;it was effortless. <br>Free of all rending and tearing, <br>free of pain and affliction, she <br>brought forth divine splendor. <br>The Celestial Lord soothing her, <br>welcoming sacrifice and prayer, <br>she bore her son in tranquillity. <br>And so he was left alone in a narrow lane, <br>but oxen and sheep nurtured him. <br>And so he was left alone on a forested plain, <br>but woodcutters gathered round. <br>And so he was left alone on a cold ice-field, <br>but birds wrapped him in wings, <br>and when the birds took flight, <br>Millet God began to wail, he <br>wailed long and wailed loud, <br>and the sound was deafening. <br>And so he soon began to crawl, <br>then stood firm as a mountain. <br>When he began to feed himself, <br>he planted broad-beans aplenty, <br>broad and wind-fluttered beans, <br>and lush grain ripening in rows, <br>wheat and hemp thick and rich, <br>and melons sprawled everywhere. <br>And so Millet God farmed, understanding <br>the Way to help things grow. <br>He cleared away thick grass <br>and planted yellow treasure. <br>The seeds swelled and rooted. <br>Planted well, they grew lovely, <br>grew tall and lovely in bloom, <br>they ripened to a fine finish <br>and bent low with rich plenty. <br>He built a house there, in T&#x2019;ai, and settled. <br>And so he gave to us exquisite <br>millet: midnight and twin-seed, <br>red-shafted and white-frosted. <br>He grew midnight and twin-seed <br>far and wide, cut acre after acre, <br>cut red-shafted and white-frosted, <br>hauled it in, shoulder and back <br>home to begin offering sacrifice. <br>And so our offerings&#x2014;how are they done? <br>Some thresh and some sweep, <br>some winnow and some tread; <br>we wash it clean, whisper-clean, <br>and steam it misty, misty sweet. <br>Pondering deeply, thoughts pure, <br>we offer artemisia soaked in fat, <br>offer rams to spirits far and wide, <br>and meat smoke-seared we offer <br>to bring forth another new year. <br>We offer bounty in altar bowls, <br>in altar bowls and holy platters, <br>and when the fragrance ascends, <br>fragrance perfect in its season, <br>our Celestial Lord rests content. <br>Millet God began these offerings, <br>and free of trespass always they <br>continued down to our own time. <br>SPRAWL <br>Melons sprawl from root. <br>In Pin riverlands, earth <br>gave birth to our people. <br>Our true old father T&#x2019;ai <br>made us shelters, kiln-huts, <br>for houses were unknown. <br>Excerpted from Classical Chinese Poetry by . <br>Copyright � 2008 by David Hinton. <br>Published in 2008 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux. <br>All rights reserved.

By showing how legislative leaders build coalitions for both types of programs, he illuminates recent legislative decisions in such areas as economic, tax, and energy policy.&nbsp;Arnold's theory of policy making rests on a reinterpretation of the relationship between legislators' actions and their constituents' policy preferences. Most scholars explore the impact that citizens' <i>existing</i> policy preferences have on legislators' decisions. They ignore citizens who have no opinions because they assume that uninformed citizens cannot possibly affect legislators' choices. Arnold examines the influence of citizens' <i>potential </i>preferences, however, and argues that legislators also respond to these preferences in order to avoid future electoral problems. He shows how legislators estimate the political consequences of their voting decisions, taking into account both the existing preferences of attentive citizens and the potential preferences of inattentive citizens. He then analyzes how coalition leaders manipulate the legislative situation in order to make it attractive for legislators to support a general interest bill.</p><p>"Arnold's book is an academic rarity&#x2015;theoretically illuminating, empirically grounded, easy to read, and highly original. It is a giant stride in the study of Congress."&#x2015;Martha Derthick<br>"[Arnold] makes an excellent argument by drawing on several literatures and by chronicling events in the areas of economic, tax, and energy policy over the past several decades. . . . An excellent, comprehensive book on Congress."&#x2015;<i>Choice</i><br>"This reviewer has no hesitation asserting that <i>The Logic of Congressional Action</i> is one of the most important books on Congress published in the past decade and that it will be widely read and discussed in the decade ahead.

Reagan, <i>Review of Politics</i><br>"This excellent and highly accessible book will become essential reading for those who wish to understand how Congress makes decisions. . . . It explicitly refutes those doomsayers who see congressional support for special interests and policy particularism as inevitable. . . . An outstanding book."&#x2015;John E. Owens, <i>American Politics Review</i><br>"An outstanding piece of work. This is the most important book of its kind since Mayhew's <i>Congress: The Electoral Connection</i> was published fifteen years ago. Arnold's work generates an abundance of fresh insights into legislative politics and expands and enriches our understanding of how the 'electoral connection' works. The book fills a serious gap in the theoretical literature on Congress, and it does so clearly, elegantly, and persuasively. It will immediately achieve the status of a book that every serious student of Congress and of public policy has to know."&#x2014;Gary C. Jacobson, author of Money in Congressional Elections and coauthor of <i>Strategy and Choice in Congressional Elections</i><br>"This will be one of the most influential books on Congress&#x2015;and hence, on American politics&#x2015;for the next ten years.

From words that never left your mouth to feelings you held on to, these words explore an unspoken space in heartbreak and pain, providing solace to the wounded soul.&nbsp;</b><br><br>With massive social media followings and a loyal fan base, Jeanty is poised for great success for his sixth poetry collection entitled <i>Apologies That Never Came</i>. In this series of prose and poetry, both the words and sentiment are simple, uninterrupted by excess flair or complexity. <i>Apologies That Never Came </i>dissects the agony of heartbreak and loss through the unexpressed words and feelings; what is left over at the end. While his poems and prose delve into pain, they ultimately transcend that heartbreak, awakening everyone's preexisting strength and capacity for growth. Much like in his previous collections, Jeanty has successfully created a tool for unity and healing out of the torment of his experiences.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;</p><p></p><h2>Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact</h2><p>Originally published in German in 1935, this monograph anticipated solutions to problems of scientific progress, the truth of scientific fact and the role of error in science now associated with the work of Thomas Kuhn and others. Arguing that every scientific concept and theory&#x2014;including his own&#x2014;is culturally conditioned, Fleck was appreciably ahead of his time. And as Kuhn observes in his foreword, "Though much has occurred since its publication, it remains a brilliant and largely unexploited resource."<br><br>"To many scientists just as to many historians and philosophers of science facts are things that simply are the case: they are discovered through properly passive observation of natural reality.

This story of heroic endeavour won Hemingway the Nobel Prize for Literature. It stands as a unique and timeless vision of the beauty and grief of man&#39;s challenge to the elements.</p><p>Here, for a change, is a fish tale that actually does honor to the author. In fact <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> revived Ernest Hemingway's career, which was foundering under the weight of such postwar stinkers as <i>Across the River and into the Trees</i>. It also led directly to his receipt of the Nobel Prize in 1954 (an award Hemingway gladly accepted, despite his earlier observation that "no son of a bitch that ever won the Nobel Prize ever wrote anything worth reading afterwards"). A half century later, it's still easy to see why. This tale of an aged Cuban fisherman going head-to-head (or hand-to-fin) with a magnificent marlin encapsulates Hemingway's favorite motifs of physical and moral challenge. Yet Santiago is too old and infirm to partake of the gun-toting machismo that disfigured much of the author's later work: "The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords." Hemingway's style, too, reverts to those superb snapshots of perception that won him his initial fame: <blockquote> Just before it was dark, as they passed a great island of Sargasso weed that heaved and swung in the light sea as though the ocean were making love with something under a yellow blanket, his small line was taken by a dolphin. He saw it first when it jumped in the air, true gold in the last of the sun and bending and flapping wildly in the air. </blockquote> If a younger Hemingway had written this novella, Santiago most likely would have towed the enormous fish back to port and posed for a triumphal photograph--just as the author delighted in doing, circa 1935. Instead his prize gets devoured by a school of sharks. Returning with little more than a skeleton, he takes to his bed and, in the very last line, cements his identification with his creator: "The old man was dreaming about the lions." Perhaps there's some allegory of art and experience floating around in there somewhere--but <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> was, in any case, the last great catch of Hemingway's career. <i>--James Marcus</i>2 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Biblical Eldership: An Urgent Call to Restore Biblical Church Leadership</h2><p>It is not enough merely to have an eldership. The eldership must be actively functioning, competent and spiritually alive. The lack of elder and deacon training is an extremely critical problem.

The text in these stunning volumes is taken from the 1867 Chapman and Hall edition, which became known as the Charles Dickens edition and was the last edition to be corrected by the author himself. The Nonesuch edition contains full-color illustrations selected by Dickens himself, by artists including Hablot Knight Browne ("Phiz"), George Cruikshank, John Leech, Robert Seymour, and George Cattermole.<br><br> <i>The Nonesuch Dickens</i> reproduces the original elegance of these beautiful editions. Books are printed on natural cream-shade high quality stock, quarter bound in bonded leather with cloth sides, include a ribbon marker, and feature special printed endpapers. Each volume is wrapped in a protective, clear acetate jacket.<br><br> The books are available as individual volumes, or as sets. The six-volume set contains <i>Oliver Twist, Bleak House, Christmas Books, Nicholas Nickleby, David Copperfield,</i> and <i>Great Expectations</i> together with <i>Hard Times</i>. The three-volume set contains <i>A Tale of Two Cities, Little Dorrit,</i> and <i>The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit</i>.Of the complex, richly rewarding masterworks he wrote in the last decade of his life, Little Dorrit is the book in which Charles Dickens most fully unleashed his indignation at the fallen state of mid-Victorian society. Crammed with persons and incidents in whose recreation nothing is accidental or spurious, containing, in its picture of the Circumlocution Office, the most witheringly exact satire of a bureaucracy we possess, Little Dorrit is a stunning example of how thoroughly Dickens could put his flair for the theatrical and his comic genius the service of his passion for justice.</p><h2>A Short Course in Photography: Film and Darkroom (9th Edition)</h2><p><p> <b> <i>Explores the fundamentals of photography &nbsp;</i> </b> </p> <p> <br> <i>A Short Course in Photography: Film and Darkroom, 9/e</i> introduces students to the fundamentals of photography and suggests ways in which they might create photographs that have meaning.

The 132nd was a division for the working day. Its story, and Bidermann's, are part of the 'master narrative' of a 'demodernizing' Wehrmacht, whose men held against unbelievable odds and in the end were sacrificed to one of history's most purely evil causes. It is a story worth making available to American readers."--Dennis Showalter, author of <i>Tannenberg: Clash of Empires</i> <p>"This memoir stands head and shoulders above the many other books in this genre. Bidermann's style is crisp, succinct, and lucid and Zumbro has done a great job of retaining the author's effective style."--David Glantz, coauthor of <i>The Battle of Kursk</i> and <i>When Titans Clashed</i></p>Gottlob Herbert Bidermann, who served in the 132nd Infantry Division, is retired from a career in the textile industry and currently resides in southern Germany. <p>Derek S. Zumbro, a retired Navy SEAL officer and resident of Hattiesburg, Mississippi, has translated German World War II accounts for the Eisenhower Center, University of New Orleans. His translations have been widely used in books and documentaries.</p></p><h2>Saul Bellow Collected Stories</h2><p>Filled with wisdom, wit, and insight, a groundbreaking collection of short works, selected by the author, traces his illustrious literary career and includes such celebrated stories as &#34;Leaving the Yellow House&#34;, &#34;What Kind of Day Did You Have?,&#34; and the novella The Bellarosa Connection.</p><p>Saul Bellow's <i>Collected Stories</i>, handpicked by the author, display the depth of character and acumen of the Nobel laureate's narrative powers. While he has garnered acclaim as a novelist, Bellow's shorter works prove equally strong. Primarily set in a sepia-toned Chicago, characters (mostly men) deal with family issues, desires, memories, and failings--often arriving at humorous if not comic situations. In the process, these quirky and wholly real characters examine human nature.<p> The narrative is straightforward, with deftly handled shifts in time, and the prose is concise, sometimes pithy, with equal parts humor and grace. In "Looking for Mr. Green," Bellow describes a relief worker sized up by tenants: "They must have realized that he was not a college boy employed afternoons by a bill collector, trying foxily to pass for a relief clerk, recognized that he was an older man who knew himself what need was, who had more than an average seasoning in hardship. It was evident enough if you looked at the marks under his eyes and at the sides of his mouth." This collection should appeal both to those familiar with Bellow's work and to those seeking an introduction. <i>--Michael Ferch</i></p>Saul Bellow is the author of thirteen novels, most recently <i>Ravelstein</i>, numerous novellas and stories, and collections of essays. He is the only novelist to have received three National Book Awards, for <i>The Adventures of Augie March</i>, <i>Herzog</i>, and <i>Mr. Sammler's Planet</i>. In 1975, he won the Pulitzer Prize for his novel <i>Humboldt's Gift</i>. The Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to him in 1976. In 1990, Mr. Bellow was presented the National Book Award Foundation Medal for distinguished contribution to American letters.</p><h2>Chickens Aren&#39;t the Only Ones (World of Nature Series)</h2><p>Ruth Heller&#39;s prose and pictures are the perfect means for discovering the variety of oviparous animals and their unique ways of laying eggs.</p><p>After receiving a fine arts degree from the University of California at Berkeley and completing two years of graduate work in design at the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland, <b>Ruth Heller</b> (1923-2004) began her career designing wrapping paper, cocktail napkins, greeting cards, and coloring books. After five years of rejection and one complete revision, Heller's first book,&nbsp;<i>Chickens Aren't the Only Ones</i>, about egg-laying animals, was published in 1981. It was so successful that the sequel, and second book to be published,&nbsp;<i>Animals Born Alive And Well</i>&nbsp;(1982), about mammals, quickly followed. In 1983 and 1984, her third and fourth titles,&nbsp;<i>The Reason For A Flower</i>&nbsp;(about plants that have seeds and flowers) and&nbsp;<i>Plants That Never Ever Bloom</i>&nbsp;(about plants that do not) were published.<br><br>She then began work on a collection of six books, the&nbsp;<i>How To Hide</i>&nbsp;series on camouflage and the magic of this phenomenon in nature, which covered the entire animal kingdom -- insects, birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and sea creatures. The next collection of books became a five-volume series on parts of speech:&nbsp;<i>A Cache of Jewels and Other Collective Nouns; Kites Sail High: A Book About Verbs; Many Luscious Lollipops: A Book About Adjectives; Merry-Go-Round: A Book About Nouns;</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Up, Up and Away: A Book About Adverbs</i>. She also wrote and illustrated the unique and fascinating book&nbsp;<i>Color</i>, a charming and instructive guide to how art goes through the four color printing process.<br><br>Among the notable people who have had an influence on Heller's writing have been: Ogden Nash, Gilbert and Sullivan, Edward Lear, Hilaire Belloc, and Dr. Seuss. Heller says of her work, "All my books are nonfiction picture books in rhyme. I find writing in rhyme enjoyable and challenging, and I think it is an easy way for children to learn new facts and acquire a sophisticated vocabulary. Children are not intimidated by big words. I try to make my writing succinct and allow the illustrations to convey as much information as possible."Text: Spanish<br> Original Language: English</p><h2>All In Startup: Launching a New Idea When Everything Is on the Line</h2><p>If Owen Chase can't find a way to turn his company around in the next nine days, he'll be forced to shut it down and lay off all of his employees.

All of French's major works are here, with 34 beautiful color reproductions spanning 30 years, providing the long-awaited opportunity to view the fascinating world of his mythic imagery.<br>A master technician, French employed the meticulous method of egg tempera to create allegorical, dreamlike images marked by a striking clarity of form. Drawing from ancient art and the figures and symbols of religious myth, French's elemental landscapes consist of oddly juxtaposed, immaculately rendered objects and human forms that capture an inner reality and cast a spell over the viewer's imagination.<br>While the art world in the '40s and '50s was focused on abstract expressionism, Jared French, along with his colleagues Paul Cadmus and George Tooker, worked against the trends of the time and looked back to the Renaissance for inspiration. French's work, while linked to Surrealism and Magic Realism, defies these categories and remains highly original. The power of his images lies in their mysteriousness; and the artist's own reticence about his work, and his self-imposed isolation during the later years of his life, create a picture of a man who is himself a mystery.<br>Nancy Grimes's illuminating essay offers an insightful analysis of French's work and explores the influences that shaped his career, including his years spent with Paul Cadmus in Italy and his summers on Fire Island, and the influence of Carl Jung and William Butler Yeats on his work. Several drawings are included, as well as a major chronology and selected exhibition history, making this book the first complete reference source of French's painting and career.</p><p></p><h2>The Semisovereign People: A Realist&#39;s View of Democracy in America</h2><p>This book started out to be an attempt to formulate a theory of political organization. While the emphasis has shifted somewhat in the course of the writing, it is still a book about political organization, an attempt to work out a theory about the relation between organization and conflict, the relation between political organization and democracy, and the organizational alternatives open to the American people. The thesis is that we shall never understand politics unless we know what the struggle is about.</p><p></p><h2>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (Everyman&#39;s Library)</h2><p><p>In his first and still most widely read novel, James Joyce makes a strange peace with the traditional narrative of a young man&#x2019;s self-discovery by respecting its substance while exploding its form, thereby inaugurating a literary revolution.</p><p>Published in 1916 when Joyce was already at work on <i>Ulysses</i>, <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i> is exactly what its title says and much more. In an exuberantly inventive masterpiece of subjectivity, Joyce portrays his alter ego, Stephen Dedalus, growing up in Dublin and struggling through religious and sexual guilt toward an aesthetic awakening. In part a vivid picture of Joyce&#x2019;s own youthful evolution into one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s greatest writers, it is also a moment in the intellectual history of an age.</p></p><p>7 1.5-hour cassettesIn his first and still most widely read novel, published in the middle of World War I, James Joyce comes to grips with his Irish Catholic upbringing and his destiny as an artist.</p><h2>Harbors and High Seas: An Atlas and Geographical Guide to the Aubrey-Maturin Novels of Patrick O&#39;Brian</h2><p>The creators of <b>A Sea of Words</b> now follow up with <b>Harbors and High Seas</b>, an invaluable tool for navigating the often uncharted terrain of the Aubrey-Maturin novels.</p><p>Where did <i>Sophie</i> battle the <i>Cacafuego</i>?

And, it's true, many of them do. But Paul Erdos never followed the usual path. At the age of four, he could ask you when you were born and then calculate the number of seconds you had been alive in his head. But he didn't learn to butter his own bread until he turned twenty. Instead, he traveled around the world, from one mathematician to the next, collaborating on an astonishing number of publications. With a simple, lyrical text and richly layered illustrations, this is a beautiful introduction to the world of math and a fascinating look at the unique character traits that made "Uncle Paul" a great man. <br>A <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> Best Book of 2013 A <i>New York Times Book Review </i>Notable Children's Book of 2013</p></p><p><p><b>Deborah Heiligman</b> has written numerous books for young readers, including <i>Charles and Emma:</i> <i>The Darwins' Leap of Faith,</i> a National Book Award finalist. She lives in New York City. </p><p><b>LeUyen Pham</b> has illustrated dozens of books for kids, including <i>God's Dream</i> by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, <i>Freckleface Strawberry</i> by Julianne Moore, and her own <i>Big Sister, Little Sister.</i></p>*Starred Review* Though eccentric mathematician Paul Erdos might seem an unusual subject for a picture book, his story makes for a memorable biography. Growing up in Hungary during WWI, Erdos tried school but chafed at the rules and convinced his mother that he should study at home. He was fascinated by numbers from an early age, and by the time he was 20, he was known as The Magician from Budapest. Unable to do common tasks such as cooking, laundry, or driving, he spent his adult life flying around the world, staying with other mathematicians, and working collaboratively on challenging math problems. Math is woven into the lively writing (Mama loved Paul to infinity. Paul loved Mama to 8, too!). The wonderfully vivid artwork, where ideas from the text are clarified, also uses decorative elements to support the idea that Erdos saw the world differently&#x2014;numerically. Heiligman appends a lengthy note about writing the book, while Pham offers a more extensive note on creating the illustrations, in which she comments on the mathematical ideas and mathematicians depicted in the art. This excellent picture-book biography celebrates a man little known outside his field, but one well worth knowing.

He is series editor of Penguin Horror."Russell links postpulp literature and the Grand Guignol tradition with the modern sensibilities of America in the 1960s. Within him resides a neo-paganistic streak that is passed from Algernon Blackwood and Sax Rohmer to him and other writers of unusual proclivities, such as Bernard J. Hurwood.

Mounce was widely praised as a standard commentary on the Apocalypse. In this new edition, now based on the text of the NIV and Nestle-Aland, Mounce has revised and expanded his work to reflect more than twenty additional years of mature thought on Revelation and to bring his work up to date with the latest scholarship. As in the original edition, Mounce here engages seriously with the various approaches to interpretation and with the conventions common to apocalyptic literature. In affirming more directly his own reading of the Apocalypse, Mounce steers a middle course between an extreme literalism and a highly imaginative subjectivism, believing this to be the way the ancient text spoke to the first-century churches to whom it was addressed - and the way it still speaks to us today.Robert H. Mounce is president emeritus of Whitworth College, Spokane, Washington, and a noted New Testament Greek scholar.

Ever since, the image of this impenetrable barrier between East and West, imposed by communism, has been a central symbol of the Cold War.<br><br>Based on vast research in untapped archival, oral, and private sources, <em>Burned Bridge</em> reveals the hidden origins of the Iron Curtain, presenting it in a startling new light. Historian Edith Sheffer's unprecedented, in-depth account focuses on Burned Bridge-the intersection between two sister cities, Sonneberg and Neustadt bei Coburg, Germany's largest divided population outside Berlin. Sheffer demonstrates that as Soviet and American forces occupied each city after the Second World War, townspeople who historically had much in common quickly formed opposing interests and identities. The border walled off irreconcilable realities: the differences of freedom and captivity, rich and poor, peace and bloodshed, and past and present. Sheffer describes how smuggling, kidnapping, rape, and killing in the early postwar years led citizens to demand greater border control on both sides--long before East Germany fortified its 1,393 kilometer border with West Germany. It was in fact the American military that built the first barriers at Burned Bridge, which preceded East Germany's borderland crackdown by many years. Indeed, Sheffer shows that the physical border between East and West was not simply imposed by Cold War superpowers, but was in some part an improvised outgrowth of an anxious postwar society.<br><br>Ultimately, a wall of the mind shaped the wall on the ground. East and West Germans became part of, and helped perpetuate, the barriers that divided them. From the end of World War II through two decades of reunification, Sheffer traces divisions at Burned Bridge with sharp insight and compassion, presenting a stunning portrait of the Cold War on a human scale.</p><p><br><strong>Edith Sheffer</strong> is Assistant Professor of History at Stanford University.<br><br>"An accessible, intriguing academic study tracking the building of the "wall in the head" between East and West Germany long before the actual construction in 1961." -Kirkus Reviews <br><p><br>"The Cold War may have been triggered by the great powers, but Edith Sheffer shows that it was also given shape and reinforced by ordinary people who confronted its political realities every day.

Clients draw with both hands and eyes closed as they focus on their felt sense. Physical pain, tension, and emotions are expressed without words through bilateral scribbles. Clients then, with an almost massage-like approach, find movements that soothe their pain, discharge inner tension and emotions, and repair boundary breaches. Archetypal shapes allow therapists to safely structure the experience in a nonverbal way. Sensorimotor art therapy is a unique and self-empowering application of somatic experiencing--it is both body-focused and trauma-informed in approach--and assists clients who have experienced complex traumatic events to actively respond to overwhelming experiences until they feel less helpless and overwhelmed and are then able to repair their memories of the past. Elbrecht provides readers with the context of body-focused, trauma-informed art therapy and walks them through the thinking behind and process of guided drawing--including 100 full-color images from client sessions that serve as helpful examples of the work.</p><p>CORNELIA ELBRECHT is founder and director of the Institute for Sensorimotor Art Therapy based in Australia. She holds degrees in fine arts and art education in addition to her extensive postgraduate training in various art therapies, Jungian analytical psychology, bioenergetics, Gestalt therapy, bodywork, martial arts, and somatic experiencing. She teaches sensorimotor art therapy throughout Australia and around the world."Cornelia Elbrecht&#x2019;s newest book&nbsp;offers an indispensable guide to help our clients overcome challenges, particularly our younger clients or community members who are hesitant to engage in more traditional 'talk' therapy modalities.&nbsp;This integrative, sensorimotor-based art therapy modality offers&nbsp;collaborative tools to awaken insight and intuition; foster focus, calm, resilience, and connection; and facilitate healing and integrate mind, brain, and body."<br> &#x2014;Bonnie Goldstein, PhD,&nbsp;Sensorimotor Psychotherapy Institute, Boulder, Colorado, and Lifespan Psychological Center, Los Angeles <br><br>"Cornelia&#x2019;s book is a much welcome and significant contribution to this field....

This volume, however, is arguably the best so far.&#x201d; &#x2015;<em>Times Literary Supplement</em></strong></p> In the last two days of his own life, Peter Carson completed these new translations of <em>The Death of Ivan Ilyich</em> and <em>Confession</em> before he succumbed to cancer in January 2013. Carson, the eminent British publisher, editor, and translator who, in the words of his author Mary Beard, &#x201c;had probably more influence on the literary landscape of [England] over the past fifty years than any other single person,&#x201d; must have seen the irony of translating <em>Ilyich</em>, Tolstoy&#x2019;s profound meditation on death and loss, &#x201c;but he pressed on regardless, apparently refusing to be distracted by the parallel of literature and life.&#x201d; In Carson&#x2019;s shimmering prose, these two transcendent works are presented in their most faithful rendering in English.

SIEGEL was born in the Bronx, New York. While living on Jerome Avenue and attending City College (CCNY) in the 1960s, he was swept up in the social and political currents of the time. He became intrigued with the influence contemporary culture had on individual behavior: did people shape society or did society shape people? He applied his interest in social forces and human behavior to the study of crime and justice. After graduating from CCNY, he attended the newly opened program in criminal justice at the State University of New York at Albany, where he earned both his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees. After completing his graduate work, Dr. Siegel began his teaching career at Northeastern University, where he was a faculty member for nine years. After leaving Northeastern, he held teaching positions at the University of Nebraska, Omaha, and Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire, and the School of Criminology and Justice Studies at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, where he taught for 27 years; he is now a professor emeritus, still teaching online courses in criminology and criminal justice. Dr. Siegel has written extensively in the area of crime and justice, including books on juvenile law, delinquency, criminology, criminal justice, and criminal procedure. He is a court-certified expert on police conduct and has testified in numerous legal cases.

Each year 4.6 million new cases occur worldwide-one new case every 7 seconds. Alzheimer&#39;s disease is the most common form of dementia. Parkinson&#39;s disease, another progressive brain disorder, affects about 4 million people worldwide. Millions more suffer with other neurodegenerative disorders. The number of people affected by these destructive diseases continues to increase every year.Dementia and other forms of neurodegeneration are not a part of the normal aging process. The brain is fully capable of functioning normally for a lifetime, regardless of how long a person lives. While aging is a risk factor for neurodegeneration, it is not the cause! Dementia and other neurodegenerative disorders are disease processes that can be prevented and successfully treated. This book outlines a program using ketone therapy and diet that is backed by decades of medical and clinical research and has proven successful in restoring mental function and improving both brain and overall health. You will learn how to prevent and even reverse symptoms associated with Alzheimer&#39;s disease, Parkinson&#39;s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), Huntington&#39;s disease, epilepsy, diabetes, stroke, and various forms of dementia.The information in this book is useful not only for those who are suffering from neurodegenerative disease but for anyone who wants to be spared from ever encountering one or more of these devastating afflictions. These diseases don&#39;t just happen overnight. They take years, often decades, to develop. In the case of Alzheimer&#39;s disease, approximately 70 percent the brain cells responsible for memory are destroyed before symptoms become noticeable.You can stop Alzheimer&#39;s and other neurodegenerative diseases before they take over your life. The best time to start is now.</p><p>Dr. Fife outlines a specific battle plan to combat these disorders, one that fits very nicely with what we know of these disorders and is easy to follow.

For more than 20 years, Lois Burdett has asked that question of her elementary school students in Stratford, Ontario, Canada, leading them on a voyage of discovery that brings the Bard to life for boys and girls ages seven and up. </p><p> <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream for Kids</i>, written in rhyming couplets is suitable for staging as class plays as well as reading aloud. </p></p><p><p><b> Shakespeare Can Be Fun! </b></p><p> Most students will be exposed to the works of Shakespeare, typically in high school. The language and content of the plays is seen as too difficult for younger children but primary children are underestimated as to what they can accomplish given the challenge. The study of Shakespeare has become an integral part of my grade two program at Hamlet School, in Stratford, Ontario, Canada. </p><p> When I first moved to Stratford, I had no intention of teaching Shakespeare to 7 and 8 year olds. Stratford is a beautiful city noted for its Shakespearean theatre and I was interested that the schools were all named after Shakespearean characters. I asked my class, "Who is William Shakespeare?" and "Why is our school called Hamlet?" Their answers were surprising. One thought he was a famous boxer. Another believed he was the President of Canada. A third student responded, "I don't know who William Shakespeare is. I don't know any of the big kids." It was the children's enthusiasm and excitement on making the connection between an historical figure and the name of their school, which led me to continue. Thirty years later I can't imagine teaching anywhere in the world and not introducing Shakespeare. The study provided tremendous growth, particularly in the area of language and communication and evolved into a learning experience of a lifetime. I have endeavored in my books and workshops for teachers to share the excitement of exploring with children, the timeless emotions and ideas of Shakespeare. </p><p> The comments of two of my children, written at various times in their daily journals show the lasting impression Shakespeare has had on them. </p><p> "Shakespeare is like a big piece of chocolate cake. Once you've started you wish you could go on and on forever, in a non-stopping dream."

The teaching methodology is applicable to a variety of introductory science courses (including biology and chemistry). However, the additional material&#x2014;class-tested, ready-to-use resources, in print and on CD-ROM (so professors can reproduce them as handouts or transparencies)&#x2014;is intended for calculus-based physics courses.</p><p>Peer Instruction is an interactive teaching style that actively involves students in the learning process by focusing attention on underlying concepts through interactive &#34;ConcepTests&#34;, reading quizzes, and conceptual exam questions. Results, asse ssed through scores on the Force Concept Inventory and final exams, show that students better understand concepts and perform better on conventional problems in this environment. It can be easily adapted to fit individual lecture styles and used with any textboo k. Eric Mazur&#39;s Peer Instruction approach has been successfully field-tested in a variety of settings, most of them quite different from his home campus at Harvard University (e.g., University of Massachusetts--Lowel and Appalachian State Universi ty).<p> Presents an entirely new approach to introductory physics within a calculus-based conceptual and a mathematical framework. It offers an approach to presenting the material that is more gradual than existing books on the subject. "Peer Instruction: A User's Manual" develops the full conceptual framework of each chapter within the first section of that chapter while addressing questions common to that topic. The material in this section concentrates on the underlying ideas and paints the big picture, whenever possible without equations. The second part of each chapter then develops the rigorous mathematical framework linked to the material presented in the first part. Each chapter also includes a short set of qualitative, conceptual questions at the end of the first section designed to strengthen the focus on the conceptual framework and facilitate understanding of the mathematical framework. The book is written in a lively, engaging style that anticipates the questions readers will have, articulates them, and answers them in a direct dialogue with the reader. MARKETS: A valuable reference book for anyone desiring an understanding of physics as it relates to engineering and science.</p></p><h2>Symbols and Allegories in Art (A Guide to Imagery)</h2><p>From antiquity, when the gods and goddesses were commonly featured in works of art, through to the twentieth century, when Surrealists drew on archetypes from the unconscious, artists have embedded symbols in their works. As with previous volumes in the Guide to Imagery series, the goal of this book is to provide contemporary readers and museum visitors with the tools to read the hidden meanings in works of art.<br> This latest volume is divided thematically into four sections featuring symbols related to time, man, space (earth and sky), and allegories or moral lessons. Readers will learn, for instance, that night, the primordial mother of the cosmos, was often portrayed in ancient art as a woman wrapped in a black veil, whereas day or noon was often represented in Renaissance art as a strong, virile man evoking the full manifestation of the sun's energy.<br> Each entry in the book contains a main reference image in which details of the symbol or allegory being analyzed are called out for discussion. In the margin, for quick access by the reader, is a summary of the essential characteristics of the symbol in question, the derivation of its name, and the religious tradition from which it springs.</p><p><br><strong>Matilde Battistini</strong> is an art critic and author, along with Stefano Zuffi, of <em>Picasso, L'opera di un genio</em> and <em>La Natura Morta</em>.<br>This sixth volume of the Getty's superb Guide to Imagery series does not disappoint, following a winning formula to satisfying results. Like its predecessors, the book lushly reproduces masterworks and breaks them down into their component parts, explaining the meanings attached to each in helpful marginal text. The volume contains a selection of exemplary paintings from the last 500 years, but it's particularly heavy on the Renaissance-familiar standouts include van Eyck's The Arnolfini Marriage, Holbein the Younger's The Ambassadors, Botticelli's Spring and several fantastic works by Bruegel the Elder. The book is divided into four sections-"Time, " "Man, " "Space" and "Allegories"-with plenty of subsections in each. For anyone unfamiliar with Renaissance symbols and tropes, this book adds depth and nuance to the sensual power of its greatest works. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Doing so successfully requires a solid foundation in general artistic principles and specific knowledge of how those principles apply to contemporary costume design. In <i>The Magic Garment,</i> Rebecca Cunningham presents readers with just such an artistic foundation and develops it to expose beginning costume designers to the myriad skills they need to develop in order to costume successful stage productions. She begins at the most basic conceptual level--reading plays from a costume designer's perspective. She then follows through with the practical considerations that must be considered at every stage of the costuming process--research, development, sketching, and costume construction. Cunningham has built on the long-standing success of the outstanding first edition with new figures and updates throughout the text, including 16 pages in full color. Examples have been selected from a wide range of stage productions representing a variety of designers, styles, and approaches. Interviews with practicing designers from stage, film, and other media show the practical importance of the book's concepts. Every chapter incorporates material reflecting the increased impact of technology, especially computers, on costuming. New chapters on designing costumes for film and television and preparing for a costume design career make the second edition even more versatile and practical for every would-be and new-to-the-job costume designer.<p> Also available from Waveland Press by Rebecca Cunningham: <i>Basic Sewing for Costume Construction: A Handbook,</i> Second Edition (ISBN 9781577667551).

As generous patrons to the likes of Botticelli and Michelangelo, the ruling Medici embodied the progressive humanist spirit of the age, and in Lorenzo de' Medici (Lorenzo the Magnificent) they possessed a diplomat capable of guarding the militarily weak city in a climate of constantly shifting allegiances between the major Italian powers. <p>However, in the form of Savonarola, an unprepossessing provincial monk, Lorenzo found his nemesis. Filled with Old Testament fury and prophecies of doom, Savonarola's sermons reverberated among a disenfranchised population, who preferred medieval Biblical certainties to the philosophical interrogations and intoxicating surface glitter of the Renaissance. Savonarola's aim was to establish a 'City of God' for his followers, a new kind of democratic state, the likes of which the world had never seen before. The battle between these two men would be a fight to the death, a series of sensational events&#x2015;invasions, trials by fire, the 'Bonfire of the Vanities', terrible executions and mysterious deaths&#x2015;featuring a cast of the most important and charismatic Renaissance figures.</p><p>Was this a simple clash of wills between a benign ruler and religious fanatic? Between secular pluralism and repressive extremism? In an exhilaratingly rich and deeply researched story, Paul Strathern reveals the paradoxes, self-doubts, and political compromises that made the battle for the soul of the Renaissance city one of the most complex and important moments in Western history.</p> 16 pages of color and B&amp;W photographs</p><p>Paul Strathern is a Somerset Maugham Award&#x2013;winning novelist, and his nonfiction works include The Venetians,&nbsp;Death in Florence, and The Medici, all available from Pegasus Books. He lives in England.&#x201c;What stands out as much as anything here is the spark and quality of Strathern's writing, its wonderful ability to combine the sweep of history withthe intensely&nbsp;personal. In&nbsp;a single sentence, Strathern captures the broad currents of civic history, the magnetic presence of a remarkable individual, and the specificity of a liturgical and biographical occasion. An engrossing narrative of power, corruption and civic life, a vivid portrait of a city in crisis and the spiritual leader who embodied its aspirations and flaws.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Washington Post</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This is&nbsp;more than a dual biography. It&#x2019;s a social and religious history, showing the tension that still holds between&nbsp;secularism and religion. A riveting narrative history.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist (starred review)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Fans of television shows such as <em>The Borgias</em> and <em>The Tudors</em>, or even <em>Game of Thrones</em>, will find no end of entertainment in this in-depth chronicle of the real-life events of the Medici family in Renaissance Florence. Lovers of medieval history will be pulled into this informative and gripping account; academics will find it a credible source of historical knowledge.

Well-considered prose.

Strathern balances both detail and narrative drive, so that you never lose sight of either one. The stories and intrigue and behind-the-scenes maneuverings will chill your blood as much as they excites it.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Providence Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Savonarola's brief reign is often treated as an interlude of religious fanaticism within the enlightened secularism of the Renaissance. In&nbsp;<em>Death in Florence</em>, Paul Strathern paints a more complicated picture, placing Savonarola within a broader context.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Shelf Awareness</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;De Medici alone is a fascinating and complicated figure, and Strathern draws a finely shaded portrait of a man who was both connoisseur of the arts and mob boss. But in his final years, de Medici encountered his one serious threat to perpetuating his family's rule: 'the little friar' Girolamo Savonarola. For Strathern, the battle was between Renaissance humanism and medieval absolutism, as Strathern illustrates in the climactic scene.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Dallas Morning News</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Grips the reader from the first page. It is an arresting and horrifying tale and Strathern tells it with immense skill and verve&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The New Statesman</em></strong></p><h2>The Art of Ancient Egypt</h2><p><p> THIS EDITION HAS BEEN REPLACED BY A NEWER EDITION.. </p><p> From the awesome grandeur of the great pyramids to the delicacy of a face etched on an amulet, the spellbinding power of the art of ancient Egypt persists to this day. This beautifully illustrated book conducts us through the splendors of this world, great and small, and into the mysteries of its fascination in its day as well as in our own. What did art, and the architecture that housed it, mean to the ancient Egyptians? Why did they invest such vast wealth and effort in its production? These are the puzzles Gay Robins explores as she examines the objects of Egyptian art--the tombs and wall paintings, the sculpture and stelae, the coffins, funerary papyri, and amulets--from its first flowering in the Early Dynastic period to its final resurgence in the time of the Ptolemies. </p><p> Spanning three thousand years, her book offers a thorough and delightfully readable introduction to the art of ancient Egypt even as it provides insight into questions that have long perplexed experts and amateurs alike. With remarkable sensitivity to the complex ways in which historical, religious, and social changes are related to changes in Egyptian art, she brings out the power and significance of the image in Egyptian belief and life. Her attention to the later period, including Ptolemaic art, shows for the first time how Egyptian art is a continuous phenomenon, changing to meet the needs of different times, right down to the eclipse of ancient Egyptian culture. In its scope, its detail, and its eloquent reproduction of over 250 objects from the British Museum and other collections in Europe, the United States, and Egypt, this volume is without parallel as a guide to the art of ancient Egypt. </p></p><p>Gay Robins is Samuel Candler Dobbs Professor of Art History at Emory University.Robins (art history, Emory Univ.) has produced the first significant general survey of ancient Egyptian art in the English language since Cyril Aldred's Egyptian Art in the Days of the Pharaohs, 3100-320 BC (Oxford Univ., 1980) and W. Stevenson Smith's The Art and Architecture of Ancient Egypt (Penguin, 1981). The first chapter orients the reader in the cultural, technical, and iconographic contexts needed to explore the evolution of the Egyptian artistic tradition in subsequent chapters. Beginning with the predynastic origins (5000 BCE) and concluding in the Ptolemaic Period (304-30 BCE), Robins traces the development of sculpture, painting, funerary and religious art, and architecture with over 300 illustrations, many in color. Unique to this survey is the inclusion of Ptolemaic art and the attention paid to the decoration of sarcophagi, coffins, and mummy cartonnages over three millennia. The text is authoritative and fully referenced with an excellent bibliography. This work will interest general readers as well as scholars and is recommended for all public and academic libraries.?Edward K. Werner, St. Lucie Cty. Lib. Sys., Ft.

Her notion of "domestic containment" is now the standard interpretation of the era, and <i>Homeward Bound</i> has become a classic.

In 1961, he published <i>Catch-22</i>, which became a bestseller and, in 1970, a film. He went on to write such novels as <i>Good as Gold, God Knows, Picture This, Closing Time</i>, and <i>Portrait of an Artist, as an Old Man</i>. Heller died in 1999.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><b>Sammy</b><br><br>When people our age speak of the war it is not of Vietnam but of the one that broke out more than half a century ago and swept in almost all the world. It was raging more than two years before we even got into it. More than twenty million Russians, they say, had perished by the time we invaded at Normandy. The tide had already been turned at Stalingrad before we set foot on the Continent, and the Battle of Britain had already been won. Yet a million Americans were casualties of battle before it was over -- three hundred thousand of us were killed in combat. Some twenty-three hundred alone died at Pearl Harbor on that single day of infamy almost half a century back -- more than twenty-five hundred others were wounded -- a greater number of military casualties on just that single day than the total in all but the longest, bloodiest engagements in the Pacific, more than on D day in France.<br><br>No wonder we finally went in.<br><br>Thank God for the atom bomb, I rejoiced with the rest of the civilized Western world, almost half a century ago, when I read the banner newspaper headlines and learned it had exploded. By then I was already back and out, unharmed and, as an ex-GI, much better off than before. I could go to college. I did go and even taught college for two years in Pennsylvania, then returned to New York and in a while found work as an advertising copywriter in the promotion department of <i>Time</i> magazine.<br><br>In only twenty years from now, certainly not longer, newspapers across the country will be printing photographs of their oldest local living veterans of that war who are taking part in the sparse parades on the patriotic holidays. The parades are sparse already. I never marched. I don't think my father did either. Way, way back, when I was still a kid, crazy Henry Markowitz, an old janitor of my father's generation in the apartment house across the street, would, on Armistice Day and Memorial Day, dig out and don his antique World War I army uniform, even down to the ragged leggings of the earlier Great War, and all that day strut on the sidewalk back and forth from the Norton's Point trolley tracks on Railroad Avenue to the candy store and soda fountain at the corner of Surf Avenue, which was nearer the ocean. Showing off, old Henry Markowitz -- like my father back then, old Henry Markowitz probably was not much past forty -- would bark commands out till hoarse to the tired women trudging home on thick legs to their small apartments carrying brown bags from the grocery or butcher, who paid him no mind. His two embarrassed daughters ignored him too, little girls, the younger my own age, the other a year or so older. He was shell-shocked, some said, but I do not think that was true. I do not think we even knew what shell-shocked meant.<br><br>There were no elevators then in our brick apartment houses, which were three and four stories high, and for the aging and the elderly, climbing steps, going home, could be hell. In the cellars you'd find coal, delivered by truck and spilled noisily by gravity down a metal chute; you'd find a furnace and boiler, and also a janitor, who might live in the building or not and whom, in intimidation more than honor, we always spoke of respectfully by his surname with the title "Mister," because he kept watch for the landlord, of whom almost all of us then, as some of us now, were always at least a little bit in fear. Just one easy mile away was the celebrated Coney Island amusement area with its gaudy lightbulbs in the hundreds of thousands and the games and rides and food stands. Luna Park was a big and famous attraction then, and so was the Steeplechase ("Steeplechase -- the Funny Place") Park of a Mr. George C. Tilyou, who had passed away long before and of whom no one knew much. Bold on every front of Steeplechase was the unforgettable trademark, a striking, garish picture in cartoon form of the grotesque, pink, flat, grinning face of a subtly idiotic man, practically on fire with a satanic hilarity and showing, incredibly, in one artless plane, a mouth sometimes almost a city block wide and an impossible and startling number of immense teeth. The attendants wore red jackets and green jockey caps and many smelled of whiskey. Tilyon had lived on Sorf Avenue in his own private house, a substantial wooden structure with a walkway to the stoop from a short flight of stone steps that descended right to the margin of the sidewalk and appeared to be sinking. By the time I was old enough to walk past on my way to the public library, subway station, or Saturday movie matinee, his family name, which had been set in concrete on the vertical face of the lowest step, was already sloping out of kilter and submerged more than halfway into the ground. In my own neighborhood, the installation of oil burners, with the excavations into the pavement for pipes and fuel tanks, was unfailingly a neighborhood event, a sign of progress.<br><br>In those twenty more years we will all look pretty bad in the newspaper pictures and television clips, kind of strange, like people in a different world, ancient and doddering, balding, seeming perhaps a little bit idiotic, shrunken, with toothless smiles in collapsed, wrinkled cheeks. People I know are already dying and others I've known are already dead. We don't look that beautiful now. We wear glasses and are growing hard of hearing, we sometimes talk too much, repeat ourselves, things grow on us, even the most minor bruises take longer to heal and leave telltale traces.<br><br>And soon after that there will be no more of us left.<br><br>Only records and mementos for others, and the images they chance to evoke. Someday one of the children -- I adopted them legally, with their consent, of course -- or one of my grown grand-children may happen upon my gunner's wings or Air Medal, my shoulder patch of sergeant's stripes, or that boyish snapshot of me -- little Sammy Singer, the best speller of his age in Coney Island and always near the top of his grade in arithmetic, elementary algebra, and plane geometry -- in my fleecy winter flight jacket and my parachute harness, taken overseas close to fifty years back on the island of Pianosa off the western shore of Italy. We are sitting with smiles for the camera near a plane in early daylight on a low stack of unfused thousand-pound bombs, waiting for the signal to start up for another mission, with our bombardier for that day, a captain, I remember, looking on at us from the background. He was a rambunctious and impulsive Armenian, often a little bit frightening, unable to learn how to navigate in the accelerated course thrown at him unexpectedly in operational training at the air base in Columbia, South Carolina, where a group of us had been brought together as a temporary crew to train for combat and fly a plane overseas into a theater of war. The pilot was a sober Texan named Appleby, who was very methodical and very good, God bless him, and the two were very quickly not getting along. My feelings lay with Yossarian, who was humorous and quick, a bit wild but, like me, a big-city boy, who would rather die than be killed, he said only half jokingly one time near the end, and had made up his mind to live forever, or at least die trying. I could identify with that. From him I learned to say no. When they offered me another stripe as a promotion and another cluster to my Air Medal to fly ten more missions, I turned them down and they sent me home. I kept all the way out of his disagreements with Appleby, because I was timid, short, an enlisted man, and a Jew. It was my nature then always to make sure of my ground with new people before expressing myself, although in principle at least, if not always with the confidence I longed for, I thought myself the equal of all the others, the officers too, even of that big, outspoken Armenian bombardier who kept joking crazily that he was really an Assyrian and already practically extinct. I was better read than all of them, I saw, and the best speller too, and smart enough, certainly, never to stress those points.<br><br>Inevitably, Yossarian got lost on every one of the night missions we flew in our operational training flights over South Carolina and Georgia. It became a joke. From the other enlisted crewmen I met in the barracks and mess hall, I learned that all of their bombardiers turned navigators got lost on all of their night training flights too, and that became another joke. The third officer in our crew was a shy copilot named Kraft, who, promoted to pilot overseas, was shot down by flak on a mission over Ferrara in northern Italy when his flight went over the bridge there in a second pass and was killed. Yossarian, the lead bombardier, who'd failed to drop the first time, got a medal for that one for going round the second time when he saw the others had missed and the bridge there was still undamaged. On those navigational training missions in South Carolina, Appleby would find the way back for us safely with his radio compass. One black night we were lost and had no radio compass for more than an hour. There was electrical interference from storms nearby, and to this day I clearly hear Yossarian's voice on the intercom, saying:<br><br>"I see the bank of a river down there. Turn left and cross it and I'll pick up a landmark on the other side."<br><br>The bank of that river turned out to be the shore of the Atlantic once more and took over after another half hour, and when he finally pieced together the radio signals to bring us back to our field, there was only enough fuel left to carry us from the landing strip to our plane stand. The engines died before they could be cut.<br><br>We had all nearly been killed.<br><br>That did not sink in until early middle age, and after that when I related the anecdote, it was not just for the laughs.<br><br>In that photograph with me is a buddy, Bill Knight, the top turret gunner that day, who was about two years older than I and already married, with a baby child he had seen but a week, and a skinny kid my own age named Howard Snowden, a waist gunner and radioman from somewhere in Alabama, who would be killed on a mission to Avignon about one month later and died slowly, moaning in pain and whimpering he was cold. We are twenty years old and look like children who are only twenty years old. Howie Snowden was the first dead human I had ever seen and the only dead human I've laid eyes on since outside a mortuary. My wife died at night and was already gone from the room by the time I arrived at the hospital to conclude the paperwork and begin the arrangements for the burial. She went the way the oncologist said she would, almsot to the day. There was skickness but seldom much pain, and we like to think she was spared that pain because she was always a very good person, at least to me, and to the children, generally cheerful and bighearted. If angry, it was only with her first husband, and only at times, particularly because he often had not enough money for child support but enough for new girlfriends and enough to marry again a couple more times. I was lucky with dead men, said Lew right after the war, a friend since childhood who was taken prisoner as an infantryman and had seen hundreds of dead people in Europe before he was shipped back home, seen Americans and Germans, and scores of German civilians in Dresden when he was send back in to help clean up after the British firebombing I learned abont first from him, an air raid that had killed just about everyone else in the city but these prisoners of war and their guards and which I did not know about and would not immediately believe.<br><br>"Above a hundred thousand? You must be crazy, Lew. That's more than Hiroshima and the atom bomb."<br><br>I looked it up and admitted he was right.<br><br>But that was almost fifty years ago. No wonder our progeny are not much interested in World War II. Hardly any were born then. They'd be around fifty if they were.<br><br>But maybe someday, in a future I can't try to measure, one of the children or grandchildren will happen upon that box or a drawer with my gunner's wings, Air Medal, sergeant's stripes, and wartime photograph inside and perhaps be stimulated to reflect with poignancy on some incidents of a family nature that once took place between us, or which never did and should have. Like me with my father's gas mask from World War I.<br><br>I wonder what became of it. I loved that gas mask as a toy when small and I would play with it secretly when he was at work in the city cutting shapes from fabric from patterns for children's dresses. I have his photograph as a soldier too. After I read, while still in elementary school, a biography of the German World War I aerial ace Baron Manfred von Richthofen, I wished for a while to grow up to be a fighter pilot and to duel with him daily in single combat over trenches in France and shoot him down again every time. He was my hero, and I dreamed of shooting him down. Soon after the war, my war, my father died and they called it cancer. He enjoyed cigars. He bought them in the small neighborhood shop around the corner on Surf Avenue, where a contented Mr. Levinson sat with his smile at a worktable with knives and tobacco leaves and marked out and rolled his cigars by hand, while Mrs. Levinson, a tranquil kind of pygmy of a woman with dark hair and freckles, sold bathing caps, earplugs, swimming tubes, and pails and shovels and other small trifles for the sand on the beach just one block away. They were childless.<br><br>Everyone worked. As a kid I hawked newspapers for a while through the streets and boardwalk bars. In summer our sisters sold frozen custard at the stands on the boardwalk, root beer. Davey Goldsmith sold hot dogs. On the beach unlicensed noddlers battled like Spartans with dry-ice vapors misting from cumbersome cartons toted in our browned arms to dispense for a nicked all of their frozen bars and Dixie cups before they could be nabbed by policemen pursuing them on soft sand through onlookers in bathing suits rooting with all their hearts for them to make good their flight. Many of these fleet-footed older young boys working so perilously were people I knew.<br><br>From our apartment we could always hear from the ocean the breaking of waves and the gong from the bell baby (we called it the "bellboy" and the still sounds rights to the unusual quiet in the early or late afternoon, we could even hear very slightly the indistinct, ghostlike music of our closest merry-go-round, the exotic calliope of the tremendous carousel on the boardwalk with its turning ring of steeds of gold the color of caramels and painted strokes of shiny black and showy tints of blue and pink of other candies, like jelly beans, licorice, and gumdrops -- where did those magnificent gliding horses come from? was there a corporation somewhere that manufactured just horses for carousels? was there big money in that? -- almost half a mile away. No one was rich.<br><br>Copyright � 1994 by Skimton, Inc.</p><h2>AVANTI: BEGINNING ITALIAN</h2><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This ISBN includes only PRINT Book. It does not include Access card<br><br>As the fastest growing introductory Italian title, Avanti! Beginning Italian continues to evolve to meet the changing needs of instructors and students. Professors are offering more hybrid and online courses, technology is providing functionality we could not envision just a few years ago, and the types of students we teach are ever-changing. Thus, in planning the third-edition revision, it was critical to retain the best parts of our program while responding to the changes around us. <br> <br> The title Avanti! conveys the forward-thinking approach of this program, which is designed to guide experienced and inexperienced instructors in creating a truly communicative, interactive environment for their students. In preparation for this edition, we employed a wide array of market research tools to identify a number of areas for digital innovation. As a direct result of our research, this new edition offers McGraw-Hill&#x2019;s Connect&#x2122; and LearnSmart&#x2122; with their game-changing, adaptive, and digital learning resources. These powerful, digital tools, now an integral part of the third edition, complement and support the goals of the Avanti! program and address the needs of the evolving Introductory Italian course. <br> <br> <strong>How does Avanti! with Connect and LearnSmart support the needs of Italian instructors and students? </strong> <br> <br> <strong>Communicative Competence: </strong> One of the major challenges of any introductory language course is to give students ample exposure to the language and sufficient opportunity for speaking practice to inspire them to communicate with confidence. Avanti! satisfies students&#x2019; desire to communicate in everyday situations right from the start. In Connect Italian students have access 24/7 to the digitally enhanced eBook, the interactive textbook activities, the online Workbook / Laboratory Manual activities, all of the accompanying audio and video resources, and the voice tools that allow for out-of-class practice of important oral skills. <br><br> <strong> Review and Recycling:</strong> Since introducing and practicing each grammatical structure once in a year-long course is simply not enough to promote acquisition, recycling vocabulary and structures for maximum exposure is a key feature of Avanti! Every fourth chapter provides practice of four previously taught grammar points, which are then followed by a related topic. With the addition of LearnSmart, a super-adaptive learning system, students can practice key vocabulary and grammatical structures outside of class. This powerful system helps students identify their weaknesses and provides them with an individualized study program based on their performance. <br><br> <strong> Manageable Scope and Sequence:</strong> Avanti! responds to instructors&#x2019; concerns that most programs attempt to cover too much material in the first year. We have designed an elementary course that reflects reasonable expectations for the amount of material that most beginning learners can acquire in one year of classroom instruction, while providing the necessary practice students need to acquire these structures. The Connect Italian platform includes an assignment builder feature that allows instructors further flexibility to fully customize the course content to meet the needs of their particular students. Instructors may choose to assign all (or a subset) of the textbook and workbook activities as well as some or all of the grammar points presented in Per saperne di pi� based on their course goals. <br><br> <strong> Cultural Competence: </strong> Avanti!&#x2019;s meaningful and extensive exploration of Italy&#x2019;s rich and unique culture is fully supported in Connect Italian through audio and video resources and interactive activities. Throughout each chapter, brief readings and interactive, culture activities promote an understanding of products, practices and perspectives. All chapters end with reading, listening, and writing activities that explore cultural topics in depth. Each chapter also includes an analysis of film clips where students can see Italian society and culture in action. <br><br> <strong> Student-centered Classroom: </strong> A significant goal of Avanti! is to engage the learner inside and outside of the classroom and promote students&#x2019; personal sense of responsibility to interact with the material and maximize learning. To this end, the inductive presentations of vocabulary and grammar, which encourage language processing and cognitive engagement, can be successfully completed in the classroom or by using the interactive versions in Connect. <br><br> <strong> Administrative Challenges: </strong> The Avanti! program provides the online tools to reduce the amount of time and energy that instructors have to invest in administering their course. The Assignment Builder allows instructors to easily sort activities according to a variety of parameters that are important to them, including by learning objective, language skill, topic, amount of time on task, or by activity type (multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, and so on). With Reports instructors can pull full administrative reports about students&#x2019; performance, and coordinators will be able to integrate these reports across all sections to see the performance of the entire program. The at-risk student report also allows instructors to quickly identify at-risk students, based on numerous criteria, who may need additional help to successfully complete the course. <br><br></p><p>Janice M.

Starting with the earliest encounters between black Americans and Western medical researchers and the racist pseudoscience that resulted, it details the ways both slaves and freedmen were used in hospitals for experiments conducted without their knowledge&#x2014;a tradition that continues today within some black populations. It reveals how blacks have historically been prey to grave-robbing as well as unauthorized autopsies and dissections. Moving into the twentieth century, it shows how the pseudoscience of eugenics and social Darwinism was used to justify experimental exploitation and shoddy medical treatment of blacks, and the view that they were biologically inferior, oversexed, and unfit for adult responsibilities. Shocking new details about the government&#x2019;s notorious Tuskegee experiment are revealed, as are similar, less-well-known medical atrocities conducted by the government, the armed forces, prisons, and private institutions.<br><br>The product of years of prodigious research into medical journals and experimental reports long undisturbed, <i>Medical Apartheid</i> reveals the hidden underbelly of scientific research and makes possible, for the first time, an understanding of the roots of the African American health deficit. At last, it provides the fullest possible context for comprehending the behavioral fallout that has caused black Americans to view researchers&#x2014;and indeed the whole medical establishment&#x2014;with such deep distrust. No one concerned with issues of public health and racial justice can afford not to read <i>Medical Apartheid</i>, a masterful book that will stir up both controversy and long-needed debate.</p><p>HARRIET A.

This is two negroes and three horses I have lost this year</i>. &#x2013;DAVID GAVIN, 1855<br>Frederick Gardiner, a peripatetic Mormon physician, left among his travel memoirs an impression of the nineteenth&#x2013;century slave markets of Washington, D.C.:<br><br>There are a great number of Negroes, nearly all of whom are Slaves. And on different Streets are large halls occupied as Marts or stores, for the sale or purchase of Slaves. . . While I have been looking at one of these places on Gravier Street, Two Gentlemen have arrived, one of whom I have Seen in the Saloon, he is a young Planter and come to purchase a girl to take care of his children, or whatever duties he may think proper to impose upon her. The other person is a Doctor whom he has brought with him for the purpose of examining her. They pass along the front of the row in company with the agent or Salesman. As they move forward One is called upon to stand up, then another while a passive examination is made. Then finally he discovers a bright mulatto, who appears about 16 years of age and is quite good looking. She is ushered into a private room where she is stripped to a nude condition and a careful examination is made of all parts of the body by the Dr. and is pronounced by him to be sound. The money is then paid and she is transferred to her new owner...I have heard that the Masters beat and scourge them most cruelly. But I have not seen anything of the kind, nor do I believe that it occurs very often. For the southern people as a class are Noble minded kind hearted people, as can be found in any country...And moreover it would be against their own interests, to brutally treat their Slaves. As no planter desired to have sick negroes on his hands. According to my judgment so far as my experience extends, I believe that the Negroes as a class, are far more humanely treated and taken care of, Than are the laboring classes of European countries (1). <br><br>Enslavement could not have existed and certainly could not have persisted without medical science. However, physicians were also dependent upon slavery, both for economic security and for the enslaved &#x201c;clinical material&#x201d; that fed the American medical research and medical training that bolstered physicians&#x2019; professional advancement. Gardiner&#x2019;s vignette suggests the integral role of medicine in enslavement and repeats a key belief&#x2014;that slave owners and physicians shared an interest in preserving the slave&#x2019;s health, &#x201c;as no planter desired to have sick negroes on his hands.&#x201d; But although medicine was essential to enslavement, the apparent solicitude for the health of slaves was not all it seemed. Rather, the medical interests of the slave were often diametrically opposed to the interests of his owner and of American physicians. From the first, antagonism reigned between African Americans and their physicians.<br><br>Between the seventeenth&#x2013;century advent of African settlers to North America and the end of the nineteenth century, the slave and the physician shared an unrecognizably primitive medical world. The &#x201c;germ theory&#x201d; that revealed the microbial nature of much disease and led to the first grand waves of disease cures was still well in the future: The existence of pathogens (2) such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi was unsuspected. Almost no effective treatments existed for prevalent diseases until the eighteenth century. Until the late 1830s, the lack of effective anesthesia made the few common surgical procedures horribly painful and all others impossible.<br><br>Between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, medicine in the United States reflected a narrowly limited understanding of disease and a rather cursory training of medical practitioners. Public&#x2013;health institutions were few, feeble, and ephemeral, rising momentarily with epidemics of yellow fever or smallpox and subsiding from neglect after the crisis resolved. Even the simplest public&#x2013;health measures&#x2014;hand washing and antiseptic techniques, clean water, sound, pathogen&#x2013;free housing, an untainted food supply, sewage management, and quantitative disease reporting were all in the future. Because there were only a few effective disease therapies and no antibiotics, epidemics of yellow fever, malaria, tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases frequently raged unchecked. In the early 1700s, this mirrored the situation in England and the rest of Europe, but medicine on the Continent began to undergo modernizing changes, although these were very slow to cross the Atlantic. Europe began to embrace public&#x2013;health measures and medical advances such as widespread vaccination, scientific medical education, and the rise of the hospital, but American progress lagged behind, especially in the insular South.<br><br>The point of this chapter&#x2019;s unflattering pr�cis of nascent American medicine is not to castigate it for its primitivism, but to put blacks&#x2019; historical aversion to medical care into context, for most antebellum blacks were subjected to southern medicine.<br><br>The South was a particularly unhealthy region and was home to 90 percent of American blacks, the majority of whom were enslaved until 1865. The first blacks arrived in the colonies in 1619, and by 1700 there were only about 20,000 blacks. But as the slave trade flourished, 20,000 more blacks arrived each year. Although 30 percent of transported slaves died in the nightmare of the Middle Passage, there were 550,000 chattel slaves in the United States by 1776, when blacks constituted 20 percent of the U.S. population. By 1807, slave importation was legally prohibited throughout the country, and by 1860, the nation&#x2019;s four million enslaved blacks had a value equivalent to four billion dollars today. In some states, the black population completely comprised slaves: Alabama, for example, forbade the presence of free blacks. <br><br>The South was the nadir of the American medical experience, visited by a deadly triple confluence&#x2014;the pathogens of North America, Europe, and Africa. This unholy trinity yielded a bewildering array of unfamiliar infectious diseases, such as hookworm, types of malaria, and yellow fever, incubated by a subtropical climate that was hospitable year&#x2013;round to pathogens that could not thrive in the colder North. Even familiar European illnesses flared anew in strangely virulent forms, abetted by the hot, marshy climate, poor sanitation, and a public&#x2013;health vacuum. Although the South harbored a highly visible affluent class, the region&#x2019;s relative poverty led to a dearth of medical care and a host of unrecognized nutritional&#x2013;deficiency diseases. So did enslavement.<br><br>A dramatically misunderstood set of disease etiologies led to the adoption of heroic remedies calculated to kill or cure. Through the eighteenth century, Western medicine was not only misinformed but dangerously so. Caustic medicines of the period often contained metabolic poisons such as arsenic, or calomel, (3) a compound of mercury and chlorine that was used as a purgative. Many other remedies contained highly toxic substances such as mercury and addictive Schedule II narcotics, including the opiates laudanum, (4) opium, and morphine, as well as cocaine derivatives. These medicines addicted, sickened, or killed outright; they also could trigger chemical pneumonitis, or progressive lung injury, if inhaled during a bout of <i>iatrogenic</i>, or physician&#x2013;triggered, vomiting. No studies seem to have been done on this point, but such lung injuries may have helped to account for slaves&#x2019; higher death rate from respiratory disease.<br><br>Induced vomiting was an everyday event because the common denominator of medical techniques in this period was the violent release of bodily fluids. Copious bleeding, blistering, and the induction of violent diarrhea were standard therapies. Harsh laxatives or &#x201c;draughts&#x201d; such as calomel or jalap (5) produced copious diarrhea, which leached nutrients, water, and electrolytes from the body. They also invited painful bedsores, which were open to infection unchallenged by antibiotics. These crude therapies were not only unpleasant but debilitating to ill persons and even to the strong and healthy. Arsenic, for example, produced not only the intended vomiting and diarrhea but also a wide range of other problems, including fainting, heart disease, disorders of the nervous system, gangrene, and cancers (6). Mercury&#x2019;s very serious effects included injury to the nervous system, profound mental deficits, hair and tooth loss, kidney and heart disease, lung injury, and respiratory distress. Mercury crossed the placental barrier and concentrated in breast milk, contributing to the high black infant&#x2013;death and birth&#x2013;defect rates (7).<br><br>Such ministrations were often fatal. The 1799 death of George Washington, hastened by a copious bloodletting the debilitated former president could ill afford, is perhaps the best&#x2013;known example of a patient finished off by the misguided heroics of eighteenth&#x2013;century medicine. However, whites of the slave&#x2013;owning class enjoyed better initial health, better nutrition, and less exposure to environmental pathogens and parasites than did enslaved blacks. Slave owners did not suffer from overwork and exposure, so they were better able than slaves to withstand the rigors of bloodletting. Sensing this, many physicians and scientists discouraged bloodletting for slaves. Thomas Jefferson, statesman and amateur physician&#x2013;scientist, wrote unequivocally, &#x201c;Never bleed a negro.&#x201d; (8) But in their everyday practices, physicians didn&#x2019;t listen. Dr. Lunsford Yandell wrote, &#x201c;On March 16, 1833 I was called before sunrise to visit a Negro woman. I took from her twelve ounces of blood...I waited about fifteen minutes when she had a severe convulsion.&#x201d; (9) Such techniques as ...</p><h2>The Norton Anthology of English Literature, Major Authors Edtion</h2><p>The Norton Anthology of English Literature</p><p><p><strong>Stephen Greenblatt</strong> (Ph.D. Yale) is Cogan University Professor of the Humanities at Harvard University.

Yet few understand how and why this has become our principal way of waging war. <i>Kill Chain</i> uncovers the real and extraordinary story; its origins in long-buried secret programs, the breakthroughs that made drone operations possible, the ways in which the technology works and, despite official claims, does not work. Taking the reader inside the well-guarded world of national security, the book reveals the powerful interests - military, CIA and corporate - that have led the drive to kill individuals by remote control. Most importantly of all, the book describes what has really happened when the theories underpinning the strategy -- and the multi-billion dollar contracts they spawn -- have been put to the test.

Drawing on scientific studies, including some surprising research, Dr. Ofri offers up an unflinching look at the impact of emotions on health care.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dr. Ofri takes us into the swirling heart of patient care, telling stories of caregivers caught up and occasionally torn down by the whirlwind life of doctoring. She admits to the humiliation of an error that nearly killed one of her patients. She mourns when a beloved patient is denied a heart transplant. She tells the riveting stories of an intern traumatized when she is forced to let a newborn&nbsp;die in her arms, and of a doctor whose daily glass of wine to handle the frustrations of the ER escalates into a destructive addiction. Ofri also reveals that doctors cope through&nbsp;gallows humor, find hope in impossible situations, and surrender to ecstatic happiness when they triumph over illness.</p><p><b>Danielle Ofri</b>, MD, PhD, is an associate professor of medicine at the New York University School of Medicine and has cared for patients at New York&#x2019;s Bellevue Hospital for more than two decades. Ofri&#x2019;s books and articles have become academic staples in medical schools, universities and residency programs. She is the editor in chief of the&nbsp;<i>Bellevue Literary Review</i>&nbsp;and writes regularly for the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>.<b>Introduction<br><br>Why Doctors Act That Way</b><br><br>The experiences of medical training and the hospital world have been extensively documented in books, television, and film. Some of this has been probing and incisive, and some has been entertaining nonsense.<br><br> Much has been written about what doctors do and how they frame their thoughts. But the emotional side of medicine&#x2014;the parts that are less rational, less amenable to systematic intervention&#x2014;has not been examined as thoroughly, yet it may be at least as important.<br><br> The public remains both fascinated and anxious about the medical world&#x2014;a world with which everyone must eventually interact. Within this fascination is a frustration that the health-care system does not function as ideally as people would like. Despite societal pressures, legislative reforms, and legal wrangling, doctors don&#x2019;t always live up to these ideals. I hope to delve beneath the cerebral side of medicine to see what actually makes MDs tick.<br><br> One might reasonably say, <i>I don&#x2019;t give a damn how my doctor feels as long as she gets me better. </i>In straightforward medical cases, this line of<i> </i>thinking is probably valid. Doctors who are angry, nervous, jealous,<i> </i>burned out, terrified, or ashamed can usually still treat bronchitis or<i> </i>ankle sprains competently.<br><br> The problems arise when clinical situations are convoluted, unyielding, or overlaid with unexpected complications, medical errors, or psychological components. This is where factors other than clinical competency come into play.<br><br> At this juncture in our society&#x2019;s history, nearly every patient&#x2014;at least those in the developed world&#x2014;can have access to the same fund of medical knowledge that doctors work from. Anyone can search WebMD for basic information or PubMed for the latest research. Medical textbooks and journals are available online. The relevant issue&#x2014; the one that has the practical impact on the patient&#x2014;is how doctors <i>use </i>that knowledge.<br><br> There has been a steady stream of research into how doctors think. In his insightful and practically titled book <i>How Doctors</i> <i>Think, </i>Jerome Groopman explored the various styles and strategies that doctors use to guide diagnosis and treatment, pointing out the flaws and strengths along the way. He studied the cognitive processes that doctors use and observed that emotions can strongly influence these thought patterns, sometimes in ways that gravely damage our patients. &#x201c;Most [medical] errors are mistakes in thinking,&#x201d; Groopman writes. &#x201c;And part of what causes these cognitive errors is our inner feelings, feelings we do not readily admit to and often don&#x2019;t even recognize.&#x201d;1<br><br> Research bears this out. Positive emotions tend to be associated with a more global view of a situation (&#x201c;the forest&#x201d;) and more flexibility in problem solving. Negative emotions tend to diminish the importance of the bigger picture in favor of the smaller details (&#x201c;the trees&#x201d;). In cognitive psychology studies, subjects with negative emotions are more prone to anchoring bias&#x2014;that is, latching on to a single detail at the expense of others. Anchoring bias is a potent source of diagnostic error, causing doctors to stick with an initial impression and avoid considering conflicting data. Subjects with positive emotions are also prone to bias; they are more likely to succumb to attribution bias. In medicine, this is the tendency to attribute a disease to who the patient is (a drug user, say) rather than what the situation is (exposure to bacteria, for example).<br><br> This is not to say that positive emotions are better or worse than negative emotions&#x2014;both are part of the normal human spectrum. But if you consider the range of cognitive territory that doctors traverse with their patients&#x2014;genetic testing, ordinary screenings, invasive procedures, ICU monitoring, and end-of-life decisions&#x2014;you can appreciate how the final outcomes can be strongly influenced by a doctor&#x2019;s emotional state.<br><br> Neuroscientist Antonio Damasio describes emotions as the &#x201c;continuous musical line of our minds, the unstoppable humming.&#x201d;3 This basso continuo thrums along while doctors make a steady stream of conscious medical decisions. How this underlying bass line affects our actions as doctors&#x2014;and the net effect on our patients (and on doctors when we ourselves become patients!)&#x2014;is what intrigues me.<br><br> By now, even the most hard-core, old-school doctors recognize that emotions are present in medicine at every level, but typically this is lumped in with the catch-all of stress or fatigue, with the unspoken assumption that with enough self-discipline, physicians can corral and master these irritants.<br><br> The emotional layers in medicine, however, are far more nuanced and pervasive than we may like to believe. In fact, they can often be the dominant players in medical decision-making, handily overshadowing evidenced-based medicine, clinical algorithms, quality control measures, even medical experience. And this can occur without anyone&#x2019;s conscious awareness.<br><br> It could easily be argued that doctors are no more emotionally complex than accountants, plumbers, or the cable-repair guy, but the net result of doctors&#x2019; behavior&#x2014;logical, emotional, irrational, or otherwise&#x2014; can have life-and-death consequences for patients, which is to say, for all of us.<br><br> We all want excellent medical care for ourselves and our families, and we&#x2019;d like to assume that the best care comes from the doctors with the best training, or the most experience, or the best <i>U.S. News</i> <i>&amp; World Report </i>rating. However, the myriad effects of emotional underpinnings can confound all of these factors.<br><br> Despite this, the conventional stereotype that doctors are fairly emotionless continues to maintain its hold. Many trace this back to the eminent Canadian physician Sir William Osler, often considered the father of modern medicine for such revolutionary ideas as whisking medical students out of the staid classroom and bringing them to the bedside to learn medicine by examining actual patients. The current educational system of clinical clerkships and residency training is largely attributed to Osler, as are hundreds of snappy quotations. His continuing influence is apparent in the scores of diseases, endless libraries, and numerous medical buildings, hospital wings, societies,&nbsp;and awards that bear his name.<br><br> On May 1, 1889, Dr. Osler stood before the graduating medical class at the University of Pennsylvania and delivered a valedictory&#x2014; and now canonical&#x2014;speech entitled &#x201c;Aequanimitas.&#x201d;4 He stressed to these fledgling doctors that &#x201c;a certain measure of insensibility is not only an advantage, but a positive necessity in the exercise of a calm judgment.&#x201d;<br><br> While Osler may not have created these attitudes, he neatly encapsulated the general feeling about how doctors should behave.<br><br> Though he did warn against &#x201c;hardening the human heart,&#x201d; the stereotype of the detached, coolheaded physician springs from this idea of equanimity.<br><br> Popular culture has embodied this. Television doctors from Ben Casey to Gregory House are detached from their patients, lauded for their technological and diagnostic acumen. Even the selflessly idealist doctors (in <i>Arrowsmith</i>, <i>Middlemarch</i>, and <i>Cutting for Stone</i>) and the bitingly sarcastic doctors (in <i>M*A*S*H</i>, <i>House of God</i>, and <i>Scrubs</i>) maintain an equanimitous distance from their patients.<br><br> Every hospital dutifully includes the word <i>compassion </i>somewhere in its mission statement. Every medical school rhapsodizes about the ideals of caring. But the often unspoken (and sometimes spoken) message in the real-life trenches of medical training is that doctors shouldn&#x2019;t get too emotionally involved with their patients. Emotions cloud judgment, students are told. Any component of a curriculum upon which interns slap the &#x201c;touchy-feely&#x201d; label is doomed in terms of attendance. Hyperefficient, technically savvy medical care is still prized over all else.<br><br> But no matter how it&#x2019;s portrayed, and no matter how many high-tech tools enter the picture, the doctor-patient interaction is still primarily a human one. And when humans connect, emotions by necessity weave an underlying network. The most distant, aloof doctor is subject to the same flood of emotions as the most touchy-feely one. Emotions are in the air just as oxygen is. But how we doctors choose&#x2014;or choose not&#x2014;to notice and process these emotions varies greatly. And it is the patient at the other end of the relationship who is affected most by this variability.<br><br> This book is intended to shed light on the vast emotional vocabulary of medicine and how it affects the practice of medicine at all levels. Hopefully, the next time we find ourselves in a patient gown, we&#x2019;ll better understand the workings of those who care for us. &#x201c;Cognition and emotion are inseparable,&#x201d; Groopman observes. &#x201c;The two mix in every encounter with every patient.&#x201d; In some scenarios, this mix is highly beneficial to patients. In others, it can be calamitous.<br><br> Understanding the positive and negative influence of emotions in the doctor-patient interaction is a crucial element in maximizing the quality of medical care. Every patient deserves the best possible care that doctors can offer. Learning to recognize and navigate the emotional subtexts is a critical tool on both sides of the exam table.</p><h2>Financial Management: Theory &amp; Practice</h2><p>The only text to strike a balance between solid financial theory and practical applications, Brigham/Ehrhardt&#39;s FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT: THEORY AND PRACTICE, 15e gives you a thorough understanding of the essential concepts you need to develop and implement effective financial strategies.

His brash style of spicy, sharp Thai party food is created, in part, by stripping down traditional recipes to wring maximum flavor out of minimum hassle. Whether it&#x2019;s a scorching hot crispy rice salad, lush coconut curries, or a wok-seared pad Thai, it&#x2019;s all about demystifying the universe of Thai flavors to make them work in your life.<br> &nbsp;<br> Kris is the chef of Night + Market, and this cookbook is the story of his journey from the Thai-American restaurant classics he grew eating at his family&#x2019;s restaurant, to the rural cooking of Northern Thailand he fell for traveling the countryside. But it&#x2019;s also a story about how he came to question what authenticity really means, and how his passion for grilled meats, fried chicken, tacos, sushi, wine and good living morphed into an L.A. Thai restaurant with a style all its own.</p><p><b>KRIS YENBAMROONG</b> has been featured in every major food publication, from Bon App�tit to Food &amp; Wine to the New York Times, and was a James Beard Award semifinalist. He also has ties to the fashion and art worlds: he worked for photographer Richard Kern; he has appeared in ads for J Crew and in magazines like Details and Esquire and on Vice.com. His restaurant group, Night + Market, is arguably the most talked about, lauded, and nationally recognized restaurant in Los Angeles.<b>DRUNKEN NOODLE PASTRAMI&nbsp;<i>PAD KEE MAO&nbsp;</i></b><br> Serves 1 or 2&nbsp;<br><br>I don&#x2019;t think anyone quite knows where the name for &#x201c;drunken noodles&#x201d; originated. <i>Pad </i>means &#x201c;to stir-fry&#x201d; and <i>kee mao </i>is a great Thai phrase that means &#x201c;someone who is prone to drunkenness,&#x201d; i.e., your uncle who usually shows up to the family reunion three whiskeys deep. Are they called drunken noodles because they&#x2019;re meant to feed people stumbling out of bars at night, or because some Thai cooks add a glug of Chinese cooking wine? I&#x2019;m not entirely sure.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> What I do know is that we sell a ton of pad kee mao at Night + Market, especially to the late-night crowd. This dish is not as iconic as <i>pad see ew </i>or pad Thai, but it does have many of the aspects people love about Thai food: It&#x2019;s spicy, fragrant, and carb-heavy enough to function as a post-drinking meal. At the restaurant we sometimes toss the noodles with short rib that&#x2019;s been pressure-cooked with soy sauce and aromatics until tender, but if you have leftover steak or roast beef on hand, then by all means slice that up and throw it in the wok.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> This version, though, is my favorite. It&#x2019;s the result of an experiment inspired by the kung pao pastrami Danny Bowien serves at Mission Chinese. It involves going to the nearest deli counter and having them slice the pastrami extra thick (� inch), then tossing it into the wok at home. Something about the combination of salty deli meats and drunken noodles makes perfect sense.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> 3 tablespoons vegetable oil&nbsp;<br> 1 tablespoon Prik Tum (pg 308), or � teaspoon each minced fresh bird&#x2019;s eye chiles and garlic&nbsp;<br> � large red bell pepper, cut into strips&nbsp;<br> 1 jalape�o pepper, seeded and cut into strips&nbsp;<br> 8 ounces fresh wide rice noodles (chow fun), separated into strands (see Note pg. 39)&nbsp;<br> 1 tablespoon sugar&nbsp;<br> 2 tablespoons Stir-Fry Sauce (pg. 306)<br> 6 ounces sliced pastrami (� inch thick), cut into 1 � 2-inch ribbons&nbsp;<br> Fish sauce&nbsp;<br> Handful of Thai basil leaves&nbsp;<br> Ground white pepper&nbsp;<br> Crispy Fried Egg (pg. 244), for topping (optional)&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> 1. Heat an empty wok over high heat until it begins to smoke, then swirl in the oil. Once the oil is shimmering, add the <i>prik tum </i>and stir until it becomes fragrant, just a few seconds. Add the bell pepper and jalape�o and stir-fry until slightly softened, 30 seconds or so. Then quickly add the rice noodles, sugar, and stir-fry sauce, tossing to coat evenly.&nbsp;<br><br>2. Once the noodles have absorbed most of the sauce, add the pastrami and toss again. Stir-fry until the meat is warmed through and the noodles have developed a slight char, then remove from the heat. Add a splash of fish sauce, the basil leaves, and a shake of white pepper and toss again to combine. Top with the fried egg, if desired.&nbsp;</p><h2>Three Famous Short Novels: Spotted Horses / Old Man / The Bear</h2><p>Three different ways to approach Faulkner, each of them representative of his work as a whole. Includes &#34;Spotted Horses,&#34; &#34;Old Man,&#34; and his famous &#34;The Bear.&#34;</p><p><b>William Cuthbert Faulkner</b> was born in 1897 and raised in Oxford, Mississippi, where he spent most of his life. One of the towering figures of American literature, he is the author of <i>The Sound and the Fury</i>, <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i>, and <i>As I Lay Dying</i>, among many other remarkable books. Faulkner was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1950 and France&#x2019;s Legion of Honor in 1951. He died in 1962.<b>Spotted Horses</b><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A little while before sundown the men lounging about the gallery of the store saw, coming up the road from the south, a covered wagon drawn by mules and followed by a considerable string of obviously alive objects which in the levelling sun resembled vari-sized and -colored tatters torn at random from large billboards&#x2014;circus posters, say&#x2014;attached to the rear of the wagon and inherent with its own separate and collective motion, like the tail of a kite.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What in the hell is that?" one said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a circus," Quick said. They began to rise, watching the wagon. Now they could see that the animals behind the wagon were horses. Two men rode in the wagon.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hell fire," the first man&#x2014;his name was Freeman&#x2014;said. "It's Flem Snopes." They were all standing when the wagon came up and stopped and Snopes got down and approached the steps. He might have departed only this morning. He wore the same cloth cap, the minute bow tie against the white shirt, the same gray trousers. He mounted the steps.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Howdy, Flem," Quick said. The other looked briefly at all of them and none of them, mounting the steps. "Starting you a circus?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gentlemen," he said. He crossed the gallery; they made way for him. Then they descended the steps and approached the wagon, at the tail of which the horses stood in a restive clump, larger than rabbits and gaudy as parrots and shackled to one another and to the wagon itself with sections of barbed wire. Calico-coated,small-bodied, with delicate legs and pink faces in which their mismatched eyes rolled wild and subdued, they huddled, gaudy motionless and alert, wild asdeer, deadly as rattlesnakes, quiet as doves. The men stood at a respectful distance, looking at them. At that moment Jody Varner came through the group, shouldering himself to the front of it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Watch yourself, doc," a voice said from the rear. But it was already too late. The nearest animal rose on its hind legs with lightning rapidity and struck twice with its fore feet at Varner's face, faster than a boxer, the movement of its surge against the wire which held it travelling backward among the rest of the band in a wave of thuds and lunges. "Hup, you broom-tailed hay-burning sidewinders," the same voice said. This was the second man who had arrived in the wagon. He was a stranger. He wore a heavy densely black moustache, a wide pale hat. When he thrust himself through and turned to herd them back from the horses they saw, thrust into the hip pockets of his tight jeans pants, the butt of a heavy pearl-handled pistol and a florid carton such as small cakes come in. "Keep away from them, boys," he said. "They've got kind of skittish, they aint been rode in so long."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since when have they been rode?" Quick said. The stranger looked at Quick. He had a broad, quite cold, wind-gnawed face and bleak cold eyes. His belly fitted neat and smooth as a peg into the tight trousers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I reckon that was when they were rode on the ferry to get across the Mississippi River," Varner said. The stranger looked at him. "My name's Varner," Jody said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hipps," the other said. "Call me Buck." Across the left side of his head, obliterating the tip of that ear, was a savage and recent gash gummed over with a blackish substance like axle-grease. They looked at the scar. Then they watched him remove the carton from his pocket and tilt a gingersnap into his hand and put the gingersnap into his mouth, beneath the moustache.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You and Flem have some trouble back yonder?" Quick said. The stranger ceased chewing. When he looked directly at anyone, his eyes became like two pieces of flint turned suddenly up in dug earth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Back where?" he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your nigh ear," Quick said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh," the other said. "That." He touched his ear. "That was my mistake. I was absent-minded one night when I was staking them out. Studying about something else and forgot how long the wire was." He chewed. They looked at his ear. "Happen to any man careless around a horse. Put a little axle-dope on it and you wont notice it tomorrow though. They're pretty lively now, lazing along all day doing nothing. It'll work out of them in a couple of days." He put another gingersnap into his mouth, chewing. "Dont you believe they'll gentle?" No one answered. They looked at the ponies, grave and noncommittal. Jody turned and went back into the store. "Them's good, gentle ponies," the stranger said. "Watch now." He put the carton back into his pocket and approached the horses, his hand extended. The nearest one was standing on three legs now. It appeared to be asleep. Its eyelid drooped over the cerulean eye; its head was shaped like an ironing-board. Without even raising the eyelid it flicked its head, the yellow teeth cropped. For an instant it and the man appeared to be inextricable in one violence. Then they became motionless, the stranger's high heels dug into the earth, one handgripping the animal's nostrils, holding the horse's head wrenched half around while it breathed in hoarse, smothered groans. "See?" the stranger said in a panting voice, the veins standing white and rigid in his neck and along his jaw. "See? All you got to do is handle them a little and work hell out of them for a couple of days. Now look out. Give me room back there." They gave back a little. The stranger gathered himself then sprang away. As he did so, a second horse slashed at his back, severing his vest from collar to hem down the back exactly as the trick swordsman severs a floating veil with one stroke.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sho now," Quick said. "But suppose a man dont happen to own a vest."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment Jody Varner, followed by the blacksmith, thrust through them again. "All right, Buck," he said. "Better get them on into the lot. Eck here will help you." The stranger, the severed halves of the vest swinging from either shoulder, mounted to the wagon seat, the blacksmith following.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get up, you transmogrified hallucinations of Job and Jezebel," the stranger said. The wagon moved on, the tethered ponies coming gaudily into motion behind it, behind which in turn the men followed at a respectful distance, on up the road and into the lane and so to the lot gate behind Mrs Littlejohn's. Eck got downand opened the gate. The wagon passed through but when the ponies saw the fence the herd surged backward against the wire which attached it to the wagon, standing on its collective hind legs and then trying to turn within itself, so that the wagon moved backward for a few feet until the Texan, cursing, managed to saw the mules about and so lock the wheels. The men following had already fallen rapidly back. "Here, Eck," the Texan said. "Get up here and take the reins." The blacksmith got back in the wagon and took the reins. Then they watched the Texan descend, carrying a looped-up black-snakewhip, and go around to the rear of the herd and drive it through the gate, the whip snaking about the harlequin rumps in methodical and pistol-like reports. Then the watchers hurried across Mrs Littlejohn's yard and mounted to the veranda, one end of which overlooked the lot.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How you reckon he ever got them tied together?" Freeman said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'd a heap rather watch how he aims to turn them loose," Quick said. The Texan had climbed back into the halted wagon. Presently he and Eck both appeared at the rear end of the open hood. The Texan grasped the wire and began to draw the first horse up to the wagon, the animal plunging and surging back against the wire as though trying to hang itself, the contagion passing back through the herd from animal to animal until they were rearing and plunging again against the wire.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on, grab aholt," the Texan said. Eck grasped the wire also. The horses laid back against it, the pink faces tossing above the back-surging mass. "Pull him up, pull him up," the Texan said sharply. "They couldn't get up herein the wagon even if they wanted to." The wagon moved gradually backward until the head of the first horse was snubbed up to the tail-gate. The Texantook a turn of the wire quickly about one of the wagon stakes. "Keep the slack out of it," he said. He vanished and reappeared, almost in the same second, with a pair of heavy wire-cutters. "Hold them like that," he said, and leaped. He vanished, broad hat, flapping vest, wire-cutters and all, into a kaleidoscopic maelstrom of long teeth and wild eyes and slashing feet, from which presently the horses began to burst one by one like partridges flushing, each wearing a necklace of barbed wire. The first one crossed the lotat top speed, on a straight line. It galloped into the fence without any diminution whatever. The wire gave, recovered, and slammed the horse to earthwhere it lay for a moment, glaring, its legs still galloping in air. It scrambled up without having ceased to gallop and crossed the lot and galloped into the opposite fence and was slammed again to earth. The others were now freed. They whipped and whirled about the lot like dizzy fish in a bowl. It had seemed like a big lot until now, but now the very idea that all that fury and motion should be transpiring inside any one fence was something to be repudiated with contempt, like a mirror trick. From the ultimate dust the stranger, carrying the wire-cutters and his vest completely gone now, emerged. He was not running, he merely moved with a light-poised and watchful celerity, weaving among the calico rushes of the animals, feinting and dodging like aboxer until he reached the gate and crossed the yard and mounted to the veranda. One sleeve of his shirt hung only at one point from his shoulder. He ripped it off and wiped his face with it and threw it away and took out the paper carton and shook a gingersnap into his hand. He was breathing only a little heavily. "Pretty lively now," he said. "But it'll workout of them in a couple of days." The ponies still streaked back and forth through the growing dusk like hysterical fish, but not so violently now.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What'll you give a man to reduce them odds a little for you?" Quick said. The Texan looked at him, the eyes bleak, pleasant and hard above the chewing jaw, the heavy moustache. "To take one of them off your hands?" Quick said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment the little periwinkle-eyed boy came along the veranda, saying, "Papa, papa; where's papa?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who you looking for, sonny?" one said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's Eck's boy," Quick said. "He's still out yonder in the wagon. Helping Mr Buck here." The boy went on to the end of the veranda, in diminutive overalls&#x2014;a miniature replica of the men themselves.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Papa," he said. "Papa." The blacksmith was still leaning from the rear of the wagon, still holding the end of the severed wire. The ponies, bunched for the moment, now slid past the wagon, flowing, stringing out again so that they appeared to have doubled in number, rushing on; the hard rapid light patter ofunshod hooves came out of the dust. "Mamma says to come on to supper," the boy said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moon was almost full then. When supper was over and they had gathered again along the veranda,the alteration was hardly one of visibility even. It was merely a translation from the lapidary-dimensional of day to the treacherous and silver receptivity in which the horses huddled in mazy camouflage, or singly or in pairs rushed, fluid, phantom, and unceasing, to huddle again in mirage-like clumps from whichcame high abrupt squeals and the vicious thudding of hooves.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratliff was among them now. He had returned just before supper. He had not dared take his team intothe lot at all. They were now in Bookwright's stable a half mile from the store. "So Flem has come home again," he said. "Well, well, well. Will Varner paid to get him to Texas, so I reckon it aint no more than fair for you fellows to pay the freight on him back." From the lot therecame a high thin squeal. One of the animals emerged. It seemed not to gallop but to flow, bodiless, without dimension. Yet there was the rapid light beat of hard hooves on the packed earth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He aint said they was his yet," Quick said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He aint said they aint neither," Freeman said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I see,"Ratliff said. "That's what you are holding back on. Until he tells you whether they are his or not. Or maybe you can wait until the auction's over and split up and some can follow Flem and some can follow that Texas fellow and watch to see which one spends the money. But then, when a man's done got trimmed, I dont reckon he cares who's got the money."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe if Ratliff would leave here tonight, they wouldn't make him buy one of them ponies tomorrow," a third said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's afact," Ratliff said. "A fellow can dodge a Snopes if he just starts lively enough. In fact, I dont believe he would have to pass more than two folks before he would have another victim intervened betwixt them. You folks aint going to buy them things sho enough, are you?" Nobody answered. They sat on the steps, their backs against the veranda posts, or on the railing itself. Only Ratliff and Quick sat in chairs, so that to them the others were black silhouettes against the dreaming lambence of the moonlight beyond the veranda. The pear tree across the road opposite was now in full and frosty bloom, the twigs and branches springing not outward from the limbs but standing motionless and perpendicular above the horizontal boughs like the separate andupstreaming hair of a drowned woman sleeping upon the uttermost floor of the windless and tideless sea.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anse McCallum brought two of them horses back from Texas once," one of the men on the steps said. He did not move to speak. He was not speaking to anyone. "It was a good team. A little light. He worked it for ten years. Light work, it was."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I mind it,"another said. "Anse claimed he traded fourteen rifle cartridges for both of them, didn't he?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was the rifletoo, I heard," a third said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, it was just the shells," the first said. "The fellow wanted to swap him four more for the rifle too, but Anse said he never needed them. Cost too much to get six of them back to Mississippi."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sho," the second said. "When a man dont have to invest so much into a horse or a team, he dont need to expect so much from it." The three of them were not talking any louder, they were merely talking among themselves, to one another, as if they sat there alone. Ratliff, invisible in the shadow against the wall, made a sound, harsh, sardonic, not loud.</p><h2>Anatomy 2 (Quick Study Academic)</h2><p>Loaded with beautifully illustrated diagrams clearly and concisely labeled for easy identification. <br> <br> Illustrations by award-winning medical illustrator Vincent Perez.</p><p></p><h2>How to Read Chinese Poetry: A Guided Anthology (How to Read Chinese Literature)</h2><p>In this "guided" anthology, experts lead students through the major genres and eras of Chinese poetry from antiquity to the modern time.

Now imagine three jumbo jets crashing on the same day. There would be cries of outrage, demands for explanations, investigations, and immediate corrections to air traffic safety.<br><br>The death toll from health care screwups adds up to at least 500,000 Americans annually. That is the equivalent of more than three jumbo jets crashing every day of the year (or over 1,000 jets annually). Because these individuals are dying at home, in hospitals, or in nursing homes, no one is counting the bodies. There is no outrage, no plan to change a system that allows too many to die unnecessarily. The medical profession seems largely immune to the consequences of its errors.<br><br>If our calculations are correct, it means that medical mistakes are the third leading cause of death in the United States, right after heart disease (631,636) and cancer (559,888) and way ahead of strokes, the next big killer (137,110).1 Teasing out the total number of people dying from health care errors turns out to be incredibly difficult. In the airline industry, when a plane crashes, the death toll is known almost immediately. But to figure out how many people die each year because of misdiagnosis, medication mistakes, preventable infections, oversights, suboptimal treatment, and just plain mess-ups, we need to consider a range of statistics. There is no one place to go for such data, and the estimates that we found vary enormously.<br><br>To Err Is Human<br><br>In 1999, an organization of the country's leading health experts issued an astonishing report titled To Err Is Human.2 The Institute of Medicine (IOM), tasked with making unbiased policy recommendations to improve the health of Americans, estimated that as many as 98,000 citizens died each year in hospitals and 1 million patients were injured from a range of mistakes. The report created a firestorm of controversy inside and outside the medical community. There was a lot of hand wringing, a fair amount of denial, and eventually some brainstorming about how to improve things.<br><br>Five years later, two of the country's leading safety experts, Lucian Leape, MD, and Donald Berwick, MD, wrote a tough article in the Journal of the American Medical Association titled: "Five Years After To Err Is Human: What Have We Learned?" The answer: not much. Their conclusion: still no nationwide monitoring system and little evidence of patient safety improvement.3<br><br>Then came another bombshell. A leading independent health care ratings organization called HealthGrades reviewed Medicare data from hospitals around the country and concluded that the IOM report had grossly underestimated the number of deaths. The 2004 report concluded that the death rate was roughly twice the previous number, or an average of 195,000 citizens dying annually from preventable in- hospital medical errors.4<br><br>Another investigative report released by journalists from the Hearst Corporation in 2009, titled Dead by Mistake, estimated that 200,000 Americans died that year from hospital infections and preventable medical errors.5 In 2010, an in-depth study from the Department of Health and Human Services estimated that 134,000 Medicare hospital patients are harmed from medical care each month and 180,000 die every year as a result.6 Almost half the deaths were preventable. This mortality number includes only senior citizens, so the total annual mortality resulting from medical care is substantially higher.<br><br>More alarming than the incredible numbers of deaths was the lobbying effort by the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, and other special-interest groups that blocked any organized system for reporting medical errors.7 A decade after all the agonizing and brainstorming by eminent experts, we still lack a way of actually detecting and tracking medical screwups. According to Christopher Landrigan, MD, a leading patient safety investigator, "We need a monitoring system that is mandatory. There has to be some mechanism for federal-level reporting, where hospitals across the country are held to it."8<br><br>Without some sort of compulsory reporting system, hospitals may miss or ignore "93 percent of events that cause either permanent or temporary harm to a patient."9 That was the conclusion the Inspector General of Health and Human Services made based on a careful review of 278 Medicare hospitalizations.10 A 2010 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine revealed that harm to patients resulting from medical care remains common, even in places where significant resources have been devoted to improving safety.11 Nearly one in five hospital patients in the study suffered harm, and two-fifths of those injuries could have been prevented.12 A study in 2011 estimated that 6.1 million Americans are injured each year due to medical misadventures.13<br><br>Dead by Mistake Key Findings<br><br>"20 states have no medical error reporting at all, five states have voluntary reporting systems and five are developing reporting systems.<br><br>"Of the 20 states that require medical error reporting, hospitals report only a tiny percentage of their mistakes, standards vary wildly and enforcement is often nonexistent.<br><br>"In terms of public disclosure, 45 states currently do not release hospital-specific information.<br><br>"Only 17 states have systematic adverse-event reporting systems that are transparent enough to be useful to consumers."14<br><br>What these data mean is that we have no idea how many people are actually dying from medical mess-ups. And, dear reader, please note that everything we have been discussing until now has to do with hospitals. It does not include nursing homes (where oversight is far less rigorous and where mishaps rarely get reported) or outpatient settings such as urgent care centers, clinics, private offices, pharmacies, or surgical centers, where physicians and other health care providers have no requirement (and a disincentive) to acknowledge or report mistakes. Even in hospitals, doctors are far less likely to report medical errors than nurses. In one study, "registered nurses provided nearly half of the reports; physicians contributed less than 2 percent."15 In another study of Massachusetts hospitals, physicians disclosed less than one-third of preventable adverse events.16<br><br>It would be reasonable to conclude that measuring medical mistakes is imprecise. In fact, research shows that "never events," that is, events that should never happen, are severely underreported. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement, an organization that promotes patient safety, has developed a standardized approach to reviewing patient records to detect signals of problems in medical care. This technique, known as the Global Trigger Tool, was used in one study to review approximately eight hundred patient records. The Global Trigger Tool identified more than 350 medical errors, while a computerized record review found thirty-five in the same set of records. Voluntary reporting had revealed only four of these mistakes. It's little wonder that the investigators concluded that relying on voluntary reporting alone could result in serious misjudgments of patient safety.17 In fact, 33 percent of the patients in this study experienced adverse events. This is ten times more than prior studies have found.<br><br>The Tip of the Iceberg<br><br>As we did our research for this book, we began to sense we were seeing only the tip of the error iceberg. To get a more comprehensive overview of the entire problem, we talked with Peter Pronovost, MD, PhD, one of the country's leading experts on patient safety. Dr. Pronovost is a professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, where he directs the Quality and Safety Research Group. He also serves as the medical director for the Center for Innovation in Quality Care. Dr. Pronovost developed a "checklist" to reduce bloodstream infections. His five-item summary of the most critical infection prevention procedures distilled from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines can be used at the bedside. Where the checklist is implemented and enforced and the infection rates are reported, hospital-acquired infections drop significantly.18 Dr. Pronovost was given a MacArthur "genius" grant in 2009 for his insights and research.<br><br>When we interviewed Dr. Pronovost on March 24, 2010, he told us that at least 100,000 people are killed each year by infections they catch in a hospital.19 He estimated that as many as 100,000 more die from diagnostic errors and suggested that the number may be double that. In addition, Dr. Pronovost counted an additional 50,000 to 100,000 who die from mistakes of commission (medical misadventures). Sins of omission are also significant; he calculated that on average, patients get only about half of the evidence-based therapies they deserve. Such sins would include things like inadequacies in diagnostic testing or not prescribing an essential medication.20 He admitted that there is no good way to evaluate the harm from these oversights, but he believes deaths from this source may even be more numerous than from any other type of mistakes. He confirmed that [it's] "absolutely right that medical mistakes are the third leading cause of death in America, and the scope of it is frightening. That hasn't really been made public."<br><br>These figures don't even include diagnostic mistakes that occur outside hospitals. No one has figured out how to count incorrect diagnoses that are made in doctors' offices, nursing homes, or urgent care clinics. There is reason to believe that these could far outstrip the number of wrong diagnoses that occur in hospitals.<br><br>Iatrogenic Deaths<br><br>The Merriam-Webster online dictionary defines iatrogenic as "induced inadvertently by a physician or surgeon or by medical treatment or diagnostic procedures." The total number of deaths that could be considered iatrogenic is difficult to determine.

He became a respected research biochemist with an anti-theistic worldview to bolster his work--and he had no intention of seeking a God he didn't believe in. That is, until the very science he loved led him to question the validity of an atheistic worldview.<p></p><p>His journey to answer the questions that confronted him drew him into becoming a fully committed Christian, determined to show others the truth: modern science doesn't contradict God at all but instead supports Christianity.</p><p></p><p>In the first half of the book, Sy begins with how his experiences and quest for knowledge as a student and early in his career brought him to question his materialist assumptions. He goes on to reveal how lessons from physics, biology, and human nature--all presented for lay readers to easily understand--actually argue for belief in God. In the second half of the book, Sy looks at the arguments often presented against God in academic and scientific settings and explains the false foundations on which they rest.</p><p></p><p>For those who have been told that the realities of science call for a rejection of God--but can't quite get rid of the feeling that this shouldn't be true--<i>The Works of His Hands</i> is an ideal reminder that the two don't have to be bitter enemies. Instead, this transformative book shares the beauty of the marriage between science and faith--and how, together, they can bring even the most unlikely to salvation.</p></p><p>Dr. Sy Garte is a biochemist and has been a professor at New York University, University of Pittsburgh, and Rutgers University. He has authored over two hundred scientific publications and four previous books, and has served as division director at the National Institutes of Health.

In <i>How to Be Free</i>, A. A. Long&#x2015;one of the world&#x2019;s leading authorities on Stoicism and a pioneer in its remarkable contemporary revival&#x2015;provides a superb new edition of Epictetus&#x2019;s celebrated guide to the Stoic philosophy of life (the <i>Encheiridion</i>) along with a selection of related reflections in his <i>Discourses</i>.</p><p>Freedom, for Epictetus, is not a human right or a political prerogative but a psychological and ethical achievement, a gift that we alone can bestow on ourselves. We can all be free, but only if we learn to assign paramount value to what we can control (our motivations and reactions), treat what we cannot control with equanimity, and view our circumstances as opportunities to do well and be well, no matter what happens to us through misfortune or the actions of other people.</p><p><i>How to Be Free</i> features splendid new translations and the original Greek on facing pages, a compelling introduction that sets Epictetus in context and describes the importance of Stoic freedom today, and an invaluable glossary of key words and concepts.

Emphasizing <i>hands-on</i> contact with the music&#x2013;through playing, singing, listening, and analyzing&#x2013;it provides six chapters on theory, each illustrated with musical examples and fully worked-out analyses, all drawn largely from the &#x201c;classical&#x201d; pre-war repertoire by Schoenberg, Stravinsky, Bartok, Berg, and Webern. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>"Straus takes a paced, methodical, logical approach to each topic. He introduces it in context and &#x2014; perhaps most significantly of all &#x2014; uses language that's so transparent that merely to follow his descriptions, explanations and illustrations carefully is to understand each aspect of the theory under consideration."&nbsp; Mark Sealey, Classical.net</p></p><p>A discussion of atonal, twelve-tone, and centric music.<p> Designed for a course in twenty-first-century techniques and analysis, this text offers a clear, comprehensive introduction to the basic concepts of post-tonal theory. Each concept is clearly explained and richly illustrated with examples from the musical literature. The text contains model analyses as well as carefully graduated exercises that involve playing, singing, composing, and analyzing. </p> <p> The third edition stays abreast of recent theoretical developments by including discussions of transformational networks and graphs, contour theory, atonal voice leading, triadic post-tonality (including neotonality), inversional symmetry, and interval cycles. As a result, this text is not only a primer of basic concepts but also an introduction to the current state of post-tonal theory, with its rich array of theoretical concepts and analytical tools. </p> <p> The third edition also features a wide range of composers and musical styles. Although the "classical" prewar repertoire of music by Schoenberg, Stravinsky, Bartok, Webern, and Berg still comprises the musical core, theoretical concepts are now also illustrated with music by Adams, Babbitt, Berio, Boulez, Britten, Cage, Carter, Cowell, Crawford, Crumb, Debussy, Feldman, Glass, Gubaidulina, Ives, Ligeti, Messiaen, Musgrave, Reich, Ruggles, Sessions, Shostakovich, Stockhausen, Varese, Wolpe, Wuorinen, and Zwillich. </p></p><h2>Eighth Shepherd (A. D. Chronicles, Book 8)</h2><p>After Yeshua of Nazareth has raised his friend El&#39;azar from the dead, news of Yeshua travels fast and the Sanhedrin begin their plot to kill him. Despite the danger, Yeshua and his followers begin the journey to Jerusalem for Passover. Meanwhile, Zachai the tax collector (Zacchaeus), the most hated man in Judea, longs to be a part of the Jewish society that he has been cut off from due to his profession. He falls into despair, believing God can&#39;t hear him and that he will always be alone. Simona, a leper who was healed by Yeshua but remains cut off from society to live in the sycamore grove, shows compassion to Zachai and tells him of Yeshua. Zachai begins his quest to find Yeshua in hopes that this man can heal his heart, just as he healed Simona&#39;s leprosy.</p><p>The Good Shepherd is rescuing lives across Israel... but is this hope for all or just for His flock? And why do so many leaders want Him dead? Zachai, chief tax collector of Jericho, is the most hated man in all of Judea. Outside the walls of his estate, he&#39;s surrounded by four giant Nubian bodyguards. But at night he&#39;s a prisoner of his aching heart. What would it be like to be loved? to have a family? Shimona, former leper from the Valley of Mak&#39;ob, returns to her hometown of Jericho to proclaim that Yeshua has healed her. When no one believes her story, she is shunned and sent to live alone as the caretaker of a grove of sukomore fig trees. Month after month she holds on tightly to hope in the midst of her loneliness. A former prince among the Nubian tribes, Salmon was betrayed and sold into slavery. Now one of the few treasures he has-his little daughter Marisha-is dying. Salmon has heard stories of Yeshua&#39;s miracles. But would the Great Shepherd have mercy on a sheep that&#39;s outside Israel&#39;s flock? Each day Marisha grows weaker.

And for a thousand years, they've had the perfect language for it. Rich in color, expressiveness, and complexity, Yiddish has proven incredibly useful and durable. Its wonderful phrases and idioms impeccably reflect the mind-set that has enabled the Jews of Europe to survive a millennium of unrelenting persecution . . . and enables them to <i>kvetch</i> about it! </p> <p> Michael Wex&#x2014;professor, scholar, translator, novelist, and performer&#x2014;takes a serious yet unceasingly fun and funny look at this remarkable kvetch-full tongue that has both shaped and has been shaped by those who speak it. Featuring chapters on curse words, food, sex, and even death, he allows his lively wit and scholarship to roam freely from Sholem Aleichem to Chaucer to Elvis. </p> <p> Perhaps only a <i>khokhem be-layle</i> (a fool, literally a "sage at night," when there's no one around to see) would care to pass up this endearing and enriching treasure trove of linguistics, sociology, history, and folklore&#x2014;an intriguing appreciation of a unique and enduring language and an equally fascinating culture. </p></p><p>The entry for "kvetchn (the verbal form) in Uriel Weinreich's "Modern English-Yiddish Yiddish-English Dictionary reads simply: "press, squeeze, pinch; strain." There is no mention of grumbling or complaint. You can "kvetch an orange to get juice, "kvetch a buzzer for service, or "kvetch mit di pleytses, shrug your shoulders, when no one responds to the buzzer that you "kvetched. All perfectly good, perfectly common uses of the verb "kvetchn, none of which appears to have the remotest connection with the idea of whining or complaining. The link is found in Weinreich's "strain" which he uses to define "kvetchn zikh, to press or squeeze oneself, the reflexive form of the verb. Alexander Harkavy's 1928 "Yiddish-English-Hebrew Dictionary helps make Weinreich's meaning clearer. It isn't simply to strain, but "to strain," as Harkavy has it, "at stool," to have trouble doing what, if you'd eaten your prunes the way you were supposed to, you wouldn't have any trouble with at all. The connection with complaint lies, of course, in the tone of voice: someone who's "kvetching sounds like someone who's paying the price for not having taken his castor oil---and he has just as eager an audience. A really good "kvetch has a visceral quality, a sense that the "kvetcher won't be completely comfortable, completely satisfied, until it's all come out. Go ahead and ask someone how they're feeling; if they tell you, "Don't ask," just remember that you already have.

Probing beneath the apparent confusion of dozens of cuisines to reveal the underlying simplicity of the culinary family tree, she shows how periodic seismic shifts in &#x201c;culinary philosophy&#x201d;&#x2015;beliefs about health, the economy, politics, society and the gods&#x2015;prompted the construction of new cuisines, a handful of which, chosen as the cuisines of empires, came to dominate the globe.<br> <br> <i>Cuisine and Empire</i> shows how merchants, missionaries, and the military took cuisines over mountains, oceans, deserts, and across political frontiers. Laudan&#x2019;s innovative narrative treats cuisine, like language, clothing, or architecture, as something constructed by humans. By emphasizing how cooking turns farm products into food and by taking the globe rather than the nation as the stage, she challenges the agrarian, romantic, and nationalistic myths that underlie the contemporary food movement.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;A triumph, pointing the way to a wholly new kind of historiography that can hold its own with more familiar work on political, economic, social, and intellectual history.&#x201c; &#x2014;G.

The pharaoh's army and navy managed to defeat them, but the victory so weakened Egypt that it soon slid into decline, as did most of the surrounding civilizations. After centuries of brilliance, the civilized world of the Bronze Age came to an abrupt and cataclysmic end. Kingdoms fell like dominoes over the course of just a few decades. No more Minoans or Mycenaeans. No more Trojans, Hittites, or Babylonians. The thriving economy and cultures of the late second millennium B.C., which had stretched from Greece to Egypt and Mesopotamia, suddenly ceased to exist, along with writing systems, technology, and monumental architecture. But the Sea Peoples alone could not have caused such widespread breakdown. How did it happen?</p><p>In this major new account of the causes of this "First Dark Ages," Eric Cline tells the gripping story of how the end was brought about by multiple interconnected failures, ranging from invasion and revolt to earthquakes, drought, and the cutting of international trade routes. Bringing to life the vibrant multicultural world of these great civilizations, he draws a sweeping panorama of the empires and globalized peoples of the Late Bronze Age and shows that it was their very interdependence that hastened their dramatic collapse and ushered in a dark age that lasted centuries.</p><p>A compelling combination of narrative and the latest scholarship, <i>1177 B.C.</i> sheds new light on the complex ties that gave rise to, and ultimately destroyed, the flourishing civilizations of the Late Bronze Age&#x2015;and that set the stage for the emergence of classical Greece.</p></p><p><p>"This enthralling book describes one of the most dramatic and mysterious processes in the history of mankind--the collapse of the Bronze Age civilizations. Cline walks us through events that transpired three millennia ago, but as we follow him on this intriguing sojourn, lurking in the back of our minds are tantalizing, perpetual questions: How can prosperous cultures disappear? Can this happen again; to us?"<b>--Israel Finkelstein, coauthor of<i>The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts</i></b></p><p>"Impressively marshaling the most recent archaeological and historical evidence, Eric Cline sets the record straight: there was a 'perfect storm' of migrations, rebellions, and climate change that resulted in the collapse of states that were already unstable in the Late Bronze Age. There followed an 'age of opportunity' for new kinds of political systems and ideologies that remade the world of the eastern Mediterranean in the first millennium B.C. Onward and upward with collapse!"<b>--Norman Yoffee, University of Michigan</b></p><p>"Cline has written a wonderfully researched and well-crafted overview of one of the most fascinating, complex, and debated periods in the history of the ancient world. Tying together an impressively broad range of disparate data, he weaves together a very convincing re-creation of the background, mechanisms, and results of the transition from the Late Bronze Age to the Iron Age in the eastern Mediterranean and beyond."<b>--Aren Maeir, Bar-Ilan University</b></p><p>"<i>1177 B.C.</i> tells the story of one of history's greatest mysteries. Unknown invaders shattered the splendid civilizations of the Bronze Age Mediterranean in a tidal wave of fire and slaughter, before Egypt's pharaoh turned them back in a fierce battle on the banks of the Nile. We do not know who these attackers were, and perhaps we never will; but no archaeologist is better equipped to guide us through this dramatic story than Eric Cline.<i>1177 B.C.</i> is the finest account to date of one of the turning points in history."<b>--Ian Morris, author of<i>Why the West Rules--for Now</i></b></p><p>"This book is a very valuable and very timely addition to the scholarship on the end of the Late Bronze Age.

Unlike most coming-of-age stories, the cycle does not end with a hero &#x201c;matured&#x201d; by circumstances. As John Seelye writes in his introduction, reversing common interpretations, <b>The Red Pony</b><i> </i>is imbued with a sense of loss. Jody&#x2019;s encounters with birth and death express a common theme in Steinbeck&#x2019;s fiction: They are parts of the ongoing process of life, &#x201c;resolving&#x201d; nothing. <b>The Red Pony</b> was central not only to Steinbeck&#x2019;s emergence as a major American novelist but to the shaping of a distinctly mid twentieth-century genre, opening up a new range of possibilities about the fictional presence of a child&#x2019;s world. This edition contains an introduction by John Seelye.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Both the valley and the coast would serve as settings for some of his best fiction. In 1919 he went to Stanford University, where he intermittently enrolled in literature and writing courses until he left in 1925 without taking a degree. During the next five years he supported himself as a laborer and journalist in New York City, all the time working on his first novel,&nbsp;<i>Cup of Gold</i>&nbsp;(1929).<br><br> After marriage and a move to Pacific Grove, he published two California books,&nbsp;<i>The Pastures of Heaven</i>&nbsp;(1932) and&nbsp;<i>To a God Unknown</i>&nbsp;(1933), and worked on short stories later collected in&nbsp;<i>The Long Valley</i>&nbsp;(1938). Popular success and financial security came only with&nbsp;<i>Tortilla Flat</i>&nbsp;(1935), stories about Monterey&#x2019;s paisanos. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly. Three powerful novels of the late 1930s focused on the California laboring class:&nbsp;<i>In Dubious Battle</i>&nbsp;(1936),&nbsp;<i>Of Mice and Men</i>&nbsp;(1937), and the book considered by many his finest,&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;(1939).&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize in 1939.<br><br> Early in the 1940s, Steinbeck became a filmmaker with&nbsp;<i>The Forgotten Village</i>&nbsp;(1941) and a serious student of marine biology with&nbsp;<i>Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1941). He devoted his services to the war, writing Bombs Away (1942) and the controversial play-novelette&nbsp;<i>The Moon is Down</i>&nbsp;(1942).<i>Cannery Row</i>&nbsp;(1945),&nbsp;<i>The Wayward Bus</i>&nbsp;(1948), another experimental drama,&nbsp;<i>Burning Bright</i>(1950), and&nbsp;<i>The Log from the Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1951) preceded publication of the monumental&nbsp;<i>East of Eden</i>&nbsp;(1952), an ambitious saga of the Salinas Valley and his own family&#x2019;s history.<br><br> The last decades of his life were spent in New York City and Sag Harbor with his third wife, with whom he traveled widely. Later books include&nbsp;<i>Sweet Thursday</i>&nbsp;(1954),&nbsp;<i>The Short Reign of Pippin IV: A Fabrication</i>&nbsp;(1957),&nbsp;<i>Once There Was a War</i>&nbsp;(1958),&nbsp;<i>The Winter of Our Discontent&nbsp;</i>(1961),<i>Travels with Charley in Search of America</i>&nbsp;(1962),&nbsp;<i>America and Americans</i>&nbsp;(1966), and the posthumously published&nbsp;<i>Journal of a Novel: The East of Eden Letters</i>&nbsp;(1969),&nbsp;<i>Viva Zapata!</i>(1975),&nbsp;<i>The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights</i>&nbsp;(1976), and&nbsp;<i>Working Days: The Journals of The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;(1989).<br><br> Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1962, and, in 1964, he was presented with the United States Medal of Freedom by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Steinbeck died in New York in 1968. Today, more than thirty years after his death, he remains one of America's greatest writers and cultural figures.&nbsp;<br><br><b>John Seelye</b> was a graduate research professor of American literature at the University of Florida.

It was to become known as the most daring enemy mission of the entire war: Operation Eagle, Himmler&#39;s audacious plan to kidnap Winston Churchill on British soil. But, despite spectacular secrecy, there was to be no surrender without a fight ...For in that remote corner of Norfolk, an elite unit is gathered together. Ready to do battle for a nation against the most ruthless task force ever assembled.</p><p>Since The Eagle Has Landed&#x2014;one of the biggest-selling thrillers of all time&#x2014;every novel Jack Higgins has written has become an international bestseller. He has had simultaneous number-one bestsellers in hardcover and paperback, and many of his books have been made into successful movies, including The Eagle Has Landed, To Catch a King, On Dangerous Ground, Eye of the Storm, and Thunder Point. He has degrees in sociology, social psychology, and economics from the University of London, and a doctorate in media from Leeds Metropolitan University. A fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, and an expert scuba diver and marksman, Higgins lives in Jersey on the Channel Islands.This early Higgins novel is an excellent choice for dramatization. The story of a daring Nazi commando raid into a small English village in 1943 has some surprising consequences. The prelude to the actual landing is staged in German and English scenes, perfectly suited to radio-style dramatization. Nazi generals with thick accents, an undercover IRA assassin using a lilting brogue and a German agent in the guise of the perfect English country woman offer excellent roles for the talented cast. The use of sound effects is good, and the production offers suspense to the last moments. R.F.W.

From a harsh, humble background that he himself described so brilliantly, Kavanagh burst through immense constraints to redefine Irish poetry - a poetry appropriate for a fully independent country, both politically and culturally. Moving beyond Irish verse&#39;s preoccupation with history, national politics and identity, he turned to the land and scenery of his native Inniskeen, portraying the closely-observed minutiae of everyday rural and urban life in an uninhibited, groundbreaking style. Lucid, various, direct and engaging, Kavanagh&#39;s poems have a unique place in the canon and a unique accessibility. This major new edition is the culmination of many years of work by Antoinette Quinn in creating authoritative texts for Kavanagh&#39;s poetry - from his early works such as &#39;Inniskeen Road: July Evening&#39; to his masterpiece, the epic &#39;The Great Hunger&#39;, allowing us to see the development of Kavanagh&#39;s genius as never before.</p><p>Patrick Kavanagh was born in Inniskeen, County Monaghan, in 1904.

The Clinton scandals will shape forever how we think about the signature issues of our day -- sex and sexual harassment, privacy and perjury, civil rights, and, yes, cigars.&nbsp;&nbsp;Toobin's book will shape forever how we think about the Clinton scandals.</p><p>What--<i>another</i> book about the messes Bill Clinton got himself into? Well, yes, but with a difference: Jeffrey Toobin's <i>A Vast Conspiracy</i> is the first to provide readers with comprehensive behind-the-scenes details of the machinations of independent counsel Kenneth Starr's team of prosecutors, lawyers for Monica Lewinsky and Paula Jones, <i>and</i> congressional members as the president's "inappropriate relationship" snowballed into the country's first impeachment proceedings in over a century.<p> Toobin's narrative is one of the most levelheaded versions of the 1998 scandal yet published, although he has very few kind words for anybody involved. "No other major political controversy in American history produced as few heroes as this one," he notes, and "in spite of his consistently reprehensible behavior, Clinton was, by comparison, the good guy in this struggle." While debunking Hillary Rodham Clinton's claims that she and her husband were the victims of a "vast right-wing conspiracy" (a claim that ignores Clinton's responsibility for his actions), Toobin does demonstrate how lawyers for Paula Jones collaborated with Linda Tripp and Lucianne Goldberg to build the most damaging case possible against the president. (He also suggests, not without cause, that <i>Newsweek</i> reporter Michael Isikoff worked more closely with Tripp and Goldberg than he reported in his own book, <i>Uncovering Clinton</i>.) </p><p> While for the most part discreetly judgmental, <i>A Vast Conspiracy</i> sometimes borders on cruel in its descriptions of Monica Lewinsky: after describing a 45-minute discussion between Clinton and his sometime sex partner, Toobin comments, "An actual conversation with Lewinsky may have been the thing that cured the president of his infatuation," and then later, "There were few better measures of Tripp's dedication to her book research and Clinton-hating than the simple fact that she tolerated Lewinsky's inane chatter for so long." Yet his portrayal of Lewinsky as "a genuine, if occasional, sexual partner as well as an obsessed, unhinged fan" is, thanks to his rich storytelling abilities, compelling. (Whether it's true remains to be seen; some readers of his previous book, <i>The Run of His Life</i>, believe that Toobin's portrayal of O.J. Simpson seriously underestimated the suspected killer.) And, although it will no doubt get overlooked amidst all the salacious details of the case, Toobin makes a good argument for how the whole brouhaha was an inevitable result of several decades of "legal activism," in which lawsuits were used to achieve broad political changes. Between Richard Posner's musings on the legal aspects of the impeachment hearings in <i>An Affair of State</i> and Toobin's narrative reconstruction of the events leading up to the impeachment, we have the beginnings of a calm consideration of just what exactly happened to American politics during Clinton's second term. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p><br><b>Praise for Jeffrey Toobin's national bestseller The Run of His Life: The People v.

The first two volumes of this work appeared in Jasper's lifetime; the third and fourth have been gathered from the vast material of his posthumous papers. This is the fourth volume. Following his original plan of "promoting the happiness that comes of meeting great men and sharing in their thoughts," Jaspers discusses Descartes, a pious Catholic who vacillated between rational philosophy and obedience to authority. Lessing, whose thought was clear, open-ended, experimental, hones. Pascal. Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Weber, who posed most penetratingly and urgently the "radical questionability of human Existenz." Marx was a dogmatic dreamer, and Einstein a great scientist, but limited in his insight into human existence.

While various powers bickered over how to slice the pie, their very presence in China, like their new technologies and Christian missions, undermined the people's traditional ways. A strange, reactionary movement&#x2015;mystical, nationalistic and virulently anti Christian&#x2015;began to spread like wildfire among the Chinese peasants. The contemptuous foreigners, snickering at their martial-arts routines, nicknamed them "The Boxers." Few could imagine that the Boxers would receive backing from China's Empress Dowager, herself eager for a showdown with the foreigners, and would soon terrorize them and the world.<br><i>The Boxer Rebellion</i> is a panoramic chronicle of the uprising and ensuing two-month siege of the 11 foreign ministries in Peking (now Beijing), and of the foreign community in Tientsin (now Tianjin) during the summer of 1900&#x2015;an event whose repercussions have echoed throughout the intervening century. It left tens of thousands of Chinese dead, precipitated the end of dynastic rule in China, and has tainted China's relationship with the wider world to this day. It is also a richly human story.<br>Relying on the diaries, letters, and memoirs of the defenders, and on her own extensive research from both Chinese and western perspectives, Diana Preston portrays the dramatic human experience of the Boxer rising: in the diplomatic district of Peking, cut off from the outside world during the desperate weeks of the siege; behind the high, byzantine walls of Peking's Inner City, where decisions were made that forever changed Chinese society; among the allied relief forces struggling to lift the siege; in the aftermath when the great city was savagely looted and despoiled. Here is young Herbert Hoover, then a mining engineer, patrolling the barricades of Tientsin at night on bicycle; British admiral Sir Edward Seymour, whose aborted rescue mission became itself a survival story; Polly Condit Smith, the observant young Boston guest of American first secretary Herbert Squiers, who was besieged in Peking; the French Bishop Auguste Favier, whose successful defense of Peking's Peitang Cathedral was nothing short of a Christian miracle; and Tzu Hsi, the fabled Empress Dowager who had held power for nearly forty years, fighting to preserve her own throne and a dynastic way of life that had lasted for centuries.<br>Placing readers squarely in the middle of events as they unfolded, Diana Preston proves herself a master of narrative history, a writer who brings the past alive with style and freshness. Offering a view through the lens of the rapid changes in society and culture at the time, <i>The Boxer Rebellion </i>broadens our knowledge of the 20th century.</p></p><p>During the 19th century, rapacious colonial powers squeezed China mercilessly, seizing territory and extorting profits while missionaries sought souls. In the late 1890s, a virulently resentful peasant movement spread across northern China; foreigners nicknamed its adherents "Boxers" for the martial-arts exercises they practiced en masse. When the movement erupted into open violence in 1900, the imperial government supported attacks on foreigners that escalated into a siege of the foreign embassies in Peking. Diana Preston's <i>The Boxer Rebellion</i> is an account of the 55-day confrontation that alarmed the world. When Western and Japanese troops eventually routed the Boxers, soldiers and civilians looted the capital (to the benefit of Western museums) and extracted yet more concessions from China. The events of 1900 showed both sides at their colorful worst, and the author spares neither Chinese cruelty nor colonial pomposity and racism. Though this narrative history is told almost entirely from a Western viewpoint--of the 200 titles in the bibliography, not one is in Chinese--the many diaries and letters that Preston consulted ensure a lively portrayal of personalities and evocation of the times. She enjoys racy rumors, whether substantiated or not, and is so enamored of the charlatan Backhouse's salacious claims that he had an affair with the Dowager Empress that she details them twice. With little analysis but all the pace and immediacy of a popular novel, <i>The Boxer Rebellion</i> makes for absorbing reading. <i>--John Stevenson</i><p>Born and raised in London, <b>Diana Preston</b> studied Modern History at Oxford University, where she first became involved in journalism. After earning her degree, she became a freelance writer of feature and travel articles for national UK newspapers and magazines and has subsequently reviewed books for a number of publications, including <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> and <i>The Los Angeles Times</i>.

Now engaged to Captain Harry Cathcart in order to avoid being shipped off to India, Rose is desperate to do something more useful than attend endless balls and parties. And the country-bred Dolly was totally at sea--and needed all the help Rose could give. But when Rose rushes to prevent Dolly from making a disastrous mistake, she discovers her stabbed to death and floating in a boat on the Serpentine River. And it isn't long before Rose barely survives an attempt on her own life. Now, Rose and Harry's race to uncover the secrets of Dolly's life is stirring up a hornet's nest of deceptions and devilish schemes from London's most exclusive townhouses to the seemingly-peaceful Yorkshire coast.

Famous for their Colossal Heads carved from giant boulders, the Olmecs have fascinated the public and archaeologists since the 1940s when <i>National Geographic</i> magazine reported the initial explorations of their centers. Despite well-publicized discoveries of spectacular basalt sculptures, portable jade objects, and richly decorated pottery vessels, until recently almost nothing was known about Olmec history, foreign contacts, and daily life.

Tour.</p><p>From the author of When Bad Things Happen to Good People comes an inspiring new bestseller that puts human feelings of guilt and inadequacy in perspective - and teaches us how we can learn to accept ourselves and others even when we and they are less than perfect. How Good Do We Have to Be? is for everyone who experiences that sense of guilt and disappointment. Harold Kushner, writing with his customary generosity and wisdom, shows us how human life is too complex for anyone to live it without making mistakes, and why we need not fear the loss of God&#39;s love when we are less than perfect. Harold Kushner begins by offering a radically new interpretation of the story of Adam and Eve, which he sees as a tale of Paradise Outgrown rather than Paradise Lost: eating from the Tree of Knowledge was not an act of disobedience, but a brave step forward toward becoming human, complete with the richness of work, sexuality and child-rearing, and a sense of our mortality. Drawing on modern literature, psychology, theology, and his own thirty years of experience as a congregational rabbi, Harold Kushner reveals how acceptance and forgiveness can change our relationships with the most important people in our lives and help us meet the bold and rewarding challenge of being human.90 minutes<br>Read by the Author<br><br>"If there were a quick fix for our trouble globe, it would be the profoundly tolerant message, teeming with humanity, at the heart of this book."<br>-Thomas Moore, author of Care of the Soul<br><br>From the author of When Bad Things Happen to Good People, comes an inspiring new bestseller that puts human feelings of guilt ad inadequacy in perspective - and teaches us how we can learn to accept out selves and others even when we are less than perfect.<br><br>Kushner begins by offering a radically new interpretation of the story of Adam and Eve, which he sees as a tale of Paradise Outgrown rather than Paradise Lost: eating from the Tree of Knowledge was not an act of disobedience, but a brave step forward toward becoming human, complete with the richness of work, sexuality, and child-rearing as well as a sense of our mortality.<br><br>Drawing on modern literature, psychology, theology, and his won thirty years of experience</p><h2>James Bond: The Man and His World, the Official Companion to Ian Fleming&#39;s Creation</h2><p>For over half a century, the Bond novels have entertained millions around the world. 007 has been a cultural phenomenon since the first publication of Casino Royale in 1953.

He winds up with an invitation to a scary voyage: "Grab onto my arm now. Hold tight. We are going into a number of dark places, but I think I know the way."<p> And he sure does. <i>Skeleton Crew</i> contains a superb short novel ("The Mist") that alone is worth the price of admission, plus two forgettable poems and 20 short stories on such themes as an evil toy monkey, a human-eating water slick, a machine that avenges murder, and unnatural creatures that inhabit the thick woods near Castle Rock, Maine. The short tales range from simply enjoyable to surprisingly good. </p><p> In addition to "The Mist," the real standout is "The Reach," a beautifully subtle story about a great-grandmother who was born on a small island off the coast of Maine and has lived there her whole life. She has never been across "the Reach," the body of water between island and mainland. This is the story that King fans give to their friends who don't read horror in order to show them how literate, how charming a storyteller he can be.

The most important tales from the three major pre-Christian sequences - the Mythological Cycle, the Ulster Cycle and the Finn Cycle - are followed by lives of the saints Patrick, Brigid and Columcille, and the result is a uniquely accessible compendium.<br>Encompassing both extremes of violence and the most sublime and tender imaginative fancy, the world of Over Nine Waves is one in which the present-day reader will have no difficulty finding his or her bearings. Marie Heaney is the ideal guide, demonstrating with authority what may still be too little known, that the ancient Irish legends are comparable in their force and profundity to any in the world.</p><p><p><b>Marie Heaney</b> was born in County Tyrone. She trained as a teacher in Belfast and began her career in schools in Northern Ireland. Married with three children, she now lives in Dublin where she works as a freelance writer, contributing to newspapers and to programmes on both RTE and BBC.</p>The legends journalist Heaney skillfully and suspensefully retells are interlinked episodes of the mythological prehistory of Ireland, a chronicle of heroic deeds, power struggles, magic, and passion. The core narratives of Irish culture--featuring the children of Lir, the voyage of Bran, the life of Cuchulainn, Deirdre, Finn, and Oisin-- are here animated by the gamut of human emotions: love, loyalty, grief, pride, and jealousy. Brief histories of Patrick, Bridget, and Columcille add a note of religious passion at the end. Violence abounds, but a young warrior must be as familiar with poetry as with weapons; and women assume important roles as leaders, poets, warriors, and healers. Although there are several volumes of Irish myths in print (most recently, Miranda Green's Celtic Myths , Univ. of Texas Pr., 1994), there is still room for one as thorough and as well written as this.

She lived in Shropshire, England.Ellis Peters brings medieval England to life with rich and wonderful descriptions of scenery, clothing, manners, and ritual. Our hero, Brother Cadfael, is a Benedictine monk, late of the Holy Crusades, through which he acquired his medicinal knowledge from the better-educated Muslims. In Shrewsbury, 1141, he needs all the wisdom he can evoke to solve a murder with no forensic medicine extant. When the harsh and unpopular Father Ailnoth is found murdered one viciously cold winter morning, there are more than enough suspects to go around. Stephen Thorne is an old hand here, having narrated many titles in this delightful series. He gives Cadfael a deep, comfortable character, bringing his kindness and gentle wisdom to the fore as the story progresses. He has a voice as easy to listen to as any heard today.

Illustrated in stunning color photographs--with a keen, insightful text by Robert Shaw--it's a fascinating chronicle of the growth and evolution of an art form with a rich heritage as well as a revealing portrait oaf what it has meant and what it means to be an American.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quilts have been made and used by Americans of every walk of life," writes Shaw in his Introduction. "Men and women, children and adults, rich and poor, educated and unschooled, New Englanders and Southerners, Anglo-Americans and African-Americans, Christians and Jews, craftspeople and artists, amateurs and professionals." His fascinating exploration of this truly democratic art covers the earliest American quilts which, contrary to myth and popular belief, were not homespun necessities pieced by hard-strapped settlers; the rising accessibility of quilting due to the industrial revolution that made cotton readily available and affordable; technological advancements like the home sewing machine that helped fuel the greatest era of quiltmaking; the digital information age that has profoundly changed the way quiltmakers communicate and learn; and much more.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>American Quilts</i> is a visually lush journey through history that will delight art and quilt enthusiasts and collectors alike.&nbsp;Trace how quilting has evolved into a democratic art form in the United States while the country developed &nbsp;as a free nation. This beautifully photographed book presents a historical perspective of a quintessentially American medium and provides a spectacular archive of quilt masterpieces.<br><i>Quilts are emblems of hope, infused with a host of meanings--some broad, national, and patriotic, others subtle, familial, and personal. They are also one of America's major art forms.

The fashion of the last century was to take them for misguided systems of hygiene. Anthropologists now interpret them as symbolic statements. Rules of purity are often treated as peculiar to primitive, foreign thought systems; but, from the starting point of modern ideas of uncleanness and dirt, Professor Douglas shows that to examine what is considered as unclean in any culture is to take a looking-glass approach to the ordered patterning which it strives to establish. Such an approach affords a more universal understanding of rules of purity, applying equally to secular and to religious life, to primitive and modern.</p><p></p><h2>A Field Guide to Getting Lost</h2><p>A series of autobiographical essays draws on key moments and relationships in the author&#39;s life to explore such issues as trust, loss, and desire, in a volume that focuses on a central theme of losing oneself in the pleasures of experience.

He wants Mommy!<br><br>No matter how scary these monsters are, there's no besting a little boy who's looking for his mommy. In one hilarious pop-up extravaganza after another, this kid shows them a thing or two.<br></p><p>Matthew Reinhart is a renowned paper engineer and bona fide STARS WARS aficionado. He created the NEW YORK TIMES bestselling STAR WARS: A POP-UP GUIDE TO THE GALAXY with Lucasfilm, published by Orchard Books. He also created DC SUPER HEROES: THE ULTIMATE POP-UP BOOK and MOMMY? by Maurice Sendak. He has worked with Robert Sabuda on many fantastic pop-up titles such as THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ; ABC DISNEY; the Encyclopedia Mythologica trilogy; and the Encyclopedia Prehistorica trilogy. He lives in New York City.PW Starred<br>Children who get the better of monsters are a Sendak specialty, fromWhere the Wild Things Are toBrundibar . In this light bite of spine-tingling fare created by Sendak, Yorinks (Hey, Al ) and Reinhart (Encyclopedia Prehistorica )-sort of a dark twist onAre You My Mother- -a mischievous boy addresses the title question to some unmaternal characters. Sendak's quintessential black-haired boy (with a strong resemblance to Mickey), wearing blue PJs and a red cap, wanders into a haunted house and naively calls, "Mommy-" Stylized, softened characters fromNosferatu and Lon Chaney creature features unfold in 3-D to menace the child, but the boy might as well be saying, "Trick or treat-", because he pulls pranks on everyone. A tall Frankenstein's monster gets ready to stomp on him; in a gatefold at the right-hand side of the spread, the disarming toddler jerks the bolts from the startled monster's neck. On a brick roof, the boy surprises a werewolf and a green goblin; the gatefold reveals the boy yanking down the Wolf Man's jeans to reveal silly boxer shorts, while the goblin giggles. In Reinhart's neatest engineering feat-a spinning dowel-and-string contraption-the not-so-harmless boy spins the white wrappings off an Egyptian "mummy." The title is the book's only word until the conclusion, when the Bride of Frankenstein at last replies to the child's question. Although the illustrious creators' do not appear until the back cover, readers cannot miss Sendak's signature graphic style. These gags are not too serious, but the suspenseful setups pointedly suggest humor's power over fear. All ages.(Sept.)<br><br>Kirkus Starred<br>Sendak's first foray into the world of pop-up books is a brilliant success. After Yorinks sets up<br>the Are You My Mother? theme with a twist, Sendak makes it his own, and Reinhardt adds the<br>surprises as a little Mickey-like boy moves through a haunted house, from monster to monster, looking<br>for his mother. None of the ghouls stands a chance against the mischievous tyke, as he unscrews<br>Frankenstein's monster's bolts, pulls down the werewolf's pants and spins the Mummy in its own<br>wrapping. This last action makes the most effective use of the pop-up possibilities: When the gatefold<br>is opened, the creature actually spins on a dowel pulled by the boy. The combined talent of Sendak,<br>Yorinks and Reinhardt offers some of the best art and artistry in the genre: As each page is opened,<br>the spread is filled with multiple pop-ups of everything from a bag of hands&#x201d; to a snake poking out<br>of a basket, as well as a side gatefold, also a pop-up, illustrating each monster's undoing. The text is<br>only one word Mommy?&#x201d; until she is found in a surprise ending and answers you guessed it <br> B-A-B-Y!&#x201d; Readers will answer, AGAIN!&#x201d; (Pop-up. All ages)<br><br>Booklist<br>Gr. 1 3. As suggested by the author credit, Scenario by Arthur Yorinks,&#x201d; Sendak's first pop-up book is more situation than story, but it's a situation well matched to the artist's cherished themes and darkest sensibilities. The mostly wordless tale features a pajama-clad toddler, who seeks his mother in a graveyard crypt (the titular query, set within speech balloons, comprises most of the text), encountering a series of Halloween-themed Wild Things along the way. The ambiguous ending, suggesting either a joyful reunion or an imminent babynapping by a zombielike Bride of Frankenstein, is as twisted, in its way, as the crying pig trussed up beneath a staircase on the first spread a perverse, mostly hidden detail that will either horrify or amuse those who discover it. Although contributions by paper engineer Matthew Reinhardt offer some whimsical moments, Sendak's staunchest fans may object to the way the mechanics fracture the artwork, compromising their idol's sure lines and celebrated design sense.

Elaine had died nearly six months earlier, and the restaurant couldn&#x2019;t make it without her. This was its last night.<br><br>&#x201c;You know,&#x201d; Dino said, gazing at the mob jammed into the place, &#x201c;if half these people had had dinner here once a week after she died, this joint would still be thriving.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; Stone said, &#x201c;but I guess the place could never be the same without Elaine to hold it together.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I feel sorry for the writers,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;There isn&#x2019;t another joint in town that gives the best tables to writers. They&#x2019;ll be wandering up and down Second Avenue, looking for someplace to eat.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And think of all the book deals that won&#x2019;t get made here,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;Where else do writers and publishers mingle?&#x201d;<br><br>All the tables had temporary tops that seated ten people, and Stone and Dino were jammed against the wall, so close to the next table that if they wanted to get to the men&#x2019;s room, they would have to stand on their chairs and walk across the table. There were two hundred people lined up on Second Avenue, waiting to get in.<br><br>Bill Eggers, the managing partner of Stone&#x2019;s law firm, Woodman &amp; Weld, spoke up from across the table. &#x201c;Never mind the writers,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;where are you two guys going to eat?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have no idea,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;There just isn&#x2019;t another place in the city that has what Elaine&#x2019;s had. Forty-eight years she was here.&#x201d;<br><br>Somebody with a video cam elbowed his way up to the table and panned around the group. Herbie Fisher and his girl and Bob Cantor and his wife were there. Holly Barker had flown up from Washington for the occasion and was staying with Stone. The cameraman moved on. Stone looked around and saw plenty of regulars: Gay Talese, Frederic Morton, David Black, Nick Taylor, Carol Higgins Clark&#x2014;all writers; photographers Harry Benson and Jessica Burstein were taking pictures; Alec Baldwin, with shaggy hair and a full beard, had found a video cam somewhere and was using it; Josh Gaspero, retired publisher, and his Thursday-night regulars were at their regular table. Gianni and Frank, the headwaiters, and all the waiters, were still there; none had left for another job before the end.<br><br>It was just like every other night at Elaine&#x2019;s, except for the three hundred extra people.<br><br>Stone had ordered the most expensive wines, because he knew Elaine would have loved that. She had liked nothing better than flogging a few bottles of Dom P�rignon of an evening.<br><br>Holly hugged Stone&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Stone, I know how you loved Elaine and her joint.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what she always called it,&#x201d; Stone said, &#x201c;her joint.&#x201d;<br><br>Dino poured himself another Johnnie Walker Black from the bottle on the table.<br><br>&#x201c;Can I get you a straw for that?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br><br>Dino handed him a bottle of Knob Creek. &#x201c;And for this?&#x201d;<br><br>A good-looking redhead Stone didn&#x2019;t recognize struggled past his table, heading for either the bar or the front door. Stone was still watching her a moment later when she was stopped by a man who had planted himself in her path. He leaned over and shouted above the din into her ear. She drew back her right hand and punched him squarely in the face. He fell, scattering drinkers, and Stone could have sworn she stepped on him as she continued out the door.<br><br>The man was helped to his feet, swearing, his nose bloody, shouting unpleasant descriptions of the redhead to anyone who would listen.<br><br>&#x201c;Did you see that?&#x201d; Holly asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I did.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She looked familiar. Do you know her?&#x201d;<br><br>Stone shook his head. &#x201c;Nope, I don&#x2019;t know any redheads.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe she wasn&#x2019;t always a redhead,&#x201d; Holly said.<br><br>&#x201c;Who knows? I don&#x2019;t know three-quarters of the people in here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t get a look at her face,&#x201d; Dino said, &#x201c;but I know the guy she knocked down, name of Billy Gaston, ex-cop, now a PI. Nasty piece of work.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Never heard of him,&#x201d; Stone said.<br><br>&#x201c;He was a street cop, made detective after you left. He was on the take from all sorts of people. The brass couldn&#x2019;t prove it, but everybody knew it. He was told he might be happier in civilian life, and he took the hint.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She really slugged him, didn&#x2019;t she?&#x201d; Stone laughed.<br><br>&#x201c;And I really enjoyed it,&#x201d; Dino said.<br><br>STONE AND Holly staggered into his house in Turtle Bay and took the elevator upstairs, necking all the way. Leaving a trail of clothing, they made their way into the bedroom to be greeted by a persistently ringing telephone. Stone looked at the instrument. His third line was ringing, the one that the answering machine didn&#x2019;t pick up. Stone pressed the speaker button and fell into bed beside Holly.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Dino.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You son of a bitch,&#x201d; Stone said, &#x201c;you knew I&#x2019;d have to pick up line three.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;I want you to listen to something. It&#x2019;s important.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Listen to something? What are you talking about?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just shut up and listen.&#x201d; There were noises, then Stone could clearly hear a female voice.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, Dino,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s Shelley. Well, not anymore, but you wouldn&#x2019;t recognize my new name. I saw you at Elaine&#x2019;s tonight. Sad, isn&#x2019;t it? The first time I was ever in the place, and it was the last night. You and Stone and Holly seemed to be having a good time, but I could tell you were a little depressed. Who were all the other people at your table? Regulars, I guess. Well, it&#x2019;s late, and I&#x2019;d better let you get to bed. I may be in town for a little while, so I&#x2019;ll call again. Maybe we can actually talk.&#x201d; There was a click.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it,&#x201d; Dino said.<br><br>Stone, Dino, and Holly had spent a lot of time in Washington, D.C., the previous summer while Dino and Stone investigated a year-old murder and a suicide, which turned into a string of five murders, all women. Turned out, the murderer had been in their midst all along.<br><br>&#x201c;Holy shit!&#x201d; Holly said. &#x201c;Shelley is in New York?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What are you going to do about it, Dino?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br><br>&#x201c;What the hell can I do about it?&#x201d; Dino asked.<br><br>&#x201c;The woman is a serial killer,&#x201d; Stone reminded him. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t ignore this.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What do you suggest?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You might keep that recording for later,&#x201d; Stone said.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, I&#x2019;ll do that. What else?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right, I&#x2019;m stumped, too. If I were you, I&#x2019;d give Kerry Smith at the FBI a call tomorrow morning and tell him about this.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, I&#x2019;ll do that, then I&#x2019;ll forget about it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sleep tight,&#x201d; Stone said, then pushed the speaker button again to disconnect.<br><br>&#x201c;So she&#x2019;s still out there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shhhhh,&#x201d; Stone said, kissing her, then he moved on to other things.<br><br><b>2</b><br><br>STONE WOKE at his usual seven a.m., but worse than usual for the wear. &#x201c;Groan,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Holly stirred beside him. &#x201c;Groan here, too. What were we drinking last night?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Bourbon and Dom P�rignon,&#x201d; Stone said, &#x201c;and I think there was some red wine in between.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My head remembers them all,&#x201d; Holly said. &#x201c;Aspirin?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In your medicine cabinet,&#x201d; he replied, and Holly padded across the bedroom to her bathroom. &#x201c;Bring me three,&#x201d; Stone called out. &#x201c;And some water.&#x201d;<br><br>Holly returned with the aspirin bottle and a glass of water, and they both partook.<br><br>&#x201c;A good breakfast will chase away the hangover,&#x201d; Stone said, picking up the phone and buzzing Helene, his housekeeper. He ordered eggs scrambled with cheese, bacon, English muffins, orange juice, and coffee, then hung up.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank God we don&#x2019;t have to fix breakfast,&#x201d; Holly said.<br><br>&#x201c;Or go out for it. Dino does that every day&#x2014;goes to some diner near his apartment.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Couldn&#x2019;t face it.&#x201d; Holly pulled the covers over her head.<br><br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t we have some sort of conversation with Dino last night? Something about Shelley Bach?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Groan again,&#x201d; Holly said, her voice muffled. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t want to know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s been a nationwide APB out for her for what&#x2014;nine, ten months? How can she elude law enforcement for that long in this day and age?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t be done,&#x201d; Holly said, still muffled.<br><br>Stone pulled down the covers far enough to expose her lips, then kissed her. &#x201c;Tell me how you&#x2019;d do that, if you were Shelley.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Holly said, &#x201c;she was an assistant director of the FBI, after all. That means she knows how law enforcement finds fleeing felons. Also, she had access to equipment and computers that would allow her to make fake IDs, driver&#x2019;s licenses, et cetera&#x2014;probably even passports. We know she switched cars early in the chase&#x2014;she probably bought a car under a false name&#x2014;and she must have had some sort of hideout ready, something out of the way and quiet. She&#x2019;s got to be calling Dino from a throwaway cell phone&#x2014;the greatest aid to criminal conduct since the blackjack. The FBI would have to be very lucky indeed to catch her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You have a point,&#x201d; Stone said.<br><br>&#x201c;I have many points.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s such a striking woman that it&#x2019;s a wonder she could move around in public without being spotted by some citizen. After all, her face was all over TV last summer and fall.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, but the only photo they had was the one on her FBI ID,&#x201d; Holly said, &#x201c;just a straight-on, washed-out black-and-white shot, no better than a mug shot, really, and her hair was short when that picture was taken. Hair dye and makeup can work wonders for a girl these days.&#x201d; She held up a strand of her auburn hair. &#x201c;Look at this.&#x201d;<br><br>The bell on the dumbwaiter rang, and Stone got out of bed and brought back the big breakfast tray, complete with the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. Stone took the front page of the Times and handed the rest to Holly.<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t face the news without something in my stomach besides champagne,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>Stone went to the bar fridge, came back with a half bottle of Schramsberg Blanc de Blanc, and popped the cork. &#x201c;Hair of the dog,&#x201d; he said, pouring half a glass and adding orange juice.<br><br>&#x201c;A mimosa,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Just the thing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A Buck&#x2019;s Fizz, the Brits call it. I like that better.&#x201d;<br><br>Holly took a long draft. &#x201c;Whatever you call it, it hits the spot.&#x201d;<br><br>They dug into breakfast.<br><br>DINO FINISHED breakfast at his local diner then got out his cell phone and speed-dialed FBI headquarters, in Washington.<br><br>&#x201c;Deputy Director Kerry Smith,&#x201d; he said to the operator. &#x201c;Lieutenant Dino Bacchetti, NYPD, calling.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Deputy Director Smith&#x2019;s office,&#x201d; a secretary said. &#x201c;Lieutenant Bacchetti?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s ... no, wait, he just got off the line.&#x201d;<br><br>There was a click, then Kerry Smith said, &#x201c;Dino?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;One and the same.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How are you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A little hungover,&#x201d; Dino admitted. &#x201c;We closed Elaine&#x2019;s last night, for the last time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You know, I never made it there,&#x201d; Kerry replied.<br><br>&#x201c;Too late now,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;You know who else was there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your former assistant director, Ms. Bach.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You saw her? Did you call it in?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, she saw me. There was a message from her on my answering machine when I got in. You want to hear it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, please.&#x201d;<br><br>Dino held the phone next to the machine and pressed the button. When she had finished talking he put the phone back to his ear. &#x201c;Could you hear that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, and I recorded it, so I don&#x2019;t have to send two agents over there to rip out your phone and take the tape.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s kind of you, Kerry. What now?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll alert the New York field office, and they&#x2019;ll take it from there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You want me to put out an APB with my department? Your guys don&#x2019;t know anything about finding a fugitive in New York.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t accept that contention, but I accept your offer of an APB. What do you think your chances are of finding her?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;About the same as yours,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;Zip, pretty much. She&#x2019;s a smart girl, you should forgive the expression, and if you haven&#x2019;t run her down so far, you&#x2019;re not likely to get her now. There are eight million stories in the city, and hers is only one of them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re probably right,&#x201d; Kerry said, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;ll deny I ever said that. There&#x2019;s more bad news on that front: Shelley had substantial inheritances from her grandfather and her mother, and she moved her capital out of the country, through a series of offshore banks. She worked on capital-tracing cases earlier in her career, so she knows how to do that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So she&#x2019;s well financed?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Extremely.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I could never get her to talk much about her background,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;What do you know about her?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Born in Philadelphia, where her grandfather owned a large department store. Her father died in a riding accident when she was seven, fell off a horse and broke his neck. She and her mother moved in with the grandparents, and she had a happy life.

Joined the Bureau for excitement, I guess, and she did well.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Suppose she shows up. What do you want me to do?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are you nuts? Arrest her!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d feel bad about that,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;We got close when I was in D.C.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, well, she and I were close for a couple of years, too, but I wouldn&#x2019;t hesitate to clap irons on her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, you would,&#x201d; Dino said.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, maybe for a second or two,&#x201d; Kerry admitted. &#x201c;She was really something.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Dino said, &#x201c;she was. See you, Kerry.&#x201d; He hung up and waved at a waitress for another cup of coffee.<br><br><b>3</b><br><br>STONE GOT a call from Bill Eggers at ten.<br><br>&#x201c;Stone, we&#x2019;ve got a client who needs the sort of attention that you&#x2019;ve given our clients in the past.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s his problem?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re having lunch with him at the Four Seasons at one o&#x2019;clock. He&#x2019;ll explain it to you then.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fine, Bill, see you there.&#x201d; Stone hung up and reflected on the kind of help he had given to clients of Woodman &amp; Weld in the past. His specialty had been to handle the kind of cases the firm did not wish to be seen handling in-house. Now that he was a partner, Stone did not particularly wish to be seen handling those cases himself. However, he could not refuse such a request from Bill Eggers out of hand. There was an etiquette involved here. Stone would have to listen to the client&#x2019;s problem, then find a way to tell Eggers that he would not handle it. He felt in a strong enough position, now, to tell him to go fuck himself, if necessary. He was responsible for three major additions to the Woodman &amp; Weld client list, one of them his late wife&#x2019;s estate, as well as himself and Peter. He made a decision: if he didn&#x2019;t want to do it, then the hell with it.<br><br>STONE ARRIVED at the Four Seasons, which occupied the ground floor of the iconic Mies van der Rohe design, the Seagram Building, which also housed Woodman &amp; Weld.

Bill was already there, and they shook hands.<br><br>Stone needed to keep his wits about him, so he ordered San Pellegrino mineral water. &#x201c;So, Bill, who&#x2019;s the client and what&#x2019;s his problem?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The client is Marshall Brennan,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;of the Brennan Group.&#x201d;<br><br>Stone didn&#x2019;t need the firm name; everybody on the planet with a room-...</p><h2>Vintage Quilts: Identifying, Collecting, Dating, Preserving &amp; Valuing</h2><p>This book identifies hundreds of quilt patterns and gives the rationale for the appraisal of each style, pattern, and era of the 650 quilts shown.

By the author of The Christmas Candle. 150,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Richard Paul Evans</b> is the bestselling author of <i>The Christmas Box, The Locket,</i> and The Christmas Box trilogy. He lives in Salt Lake City, Utah, with his wife and their five children. His four daughters were the inspiration for this story. Mr. Evans has donated all of his proceeds from this book to The Christmas Box House International?, a nonprofit organization devoted to the building of shelter-assessment facilities for abused children.Though Evans's (The Christmas Box) name is no stranger to bestseller lists, it is the exquisite art from a first-time illustrator that most impresses in this volume. Marked by photographic sharpness, Linton's oil paintings crystallize the emotion in the sparse narrative, which opens with the simple statement "A father once had a daughter." Through the years, the devoted parent smiles as he watchesAfrom a tactful distanceAas his daughter engages in her favorite activity: dancing. In Linton's memorable images, the girl dances in the yard, in a school play, as a soloist in The Nutcracker, on the porch after her first prom and at her wedding. Finally, the ailing, aged father calls his grown-up daughter to his bedside, where she grants his request to dance for him one more time, and he makes a promise: "Though you will not see me, whenever you dance, I will be watching." With its heart-tugging sentiment and adult perspective, the story may find a more appreciative audience among fathers and grown-up daughters than among children. Yet Evans's introduction will give any reader pause; here he notes that Linton painted the book's cover illustration of a golden-haired child from a photograph of a girl who with her mother had been killed in a car accident months before. Included is an affecting religious poem ("I have two angels... that abide with me. It is His way. Two by Two") written by the child's father that complements the life-affirming message of the text.

With a fresh perspective, mother, wife, and teacher Margaret Kim Peterson examines the activities and attitudes of keeping house and making a home. Debunking the commonly held notion that keeping house is a waste of time or at best a hobby, Peterson uncovers the broader cultural and theological factors that make housekeeping an interesting and worthwhile discipline. She reveals how the seemingly ordinary tasks of folding laundry, buying groceries, cooking, making beds, and offering hospitality can be seen as spiritual practices that embody and express concrete and positive ways of living out Christian faith in relationship to others at home, in the church and in the world.</p><p><b>Praise for <i>Keeping House</i></b> <p>"Addressing such topics as laundry, cleaning, shopping, and cooking, Peterson offers persuasive biblical interpretations and incisive theological and culutural commentary."<br> &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p> <p>"<i>Keeping House</i> is ground-breaking and breath-taking&#x2014;the former because there is nothing quite like a 'theology of housekeeping' that is both theologically sophisticated and experientially based. It is breath-taking because of the depth and profundity of Margaret Kim Peterson's insights . . . . My skepticism of the topic gave way, within two pages, to admiration. Every pastor needs to preach the theology of this book and every housekeeper will find daily gold."<br> &#x2014;Scot McKnight, Karl A. Olsson Professor in Religious Studies, North Park University; and author, <i>The Real Mary and The Jesus Creed</i></p> <p>"Mom taught us how to keep house; Margaret Kim Peterson tells us why. Without glorifying menial tasks or patronizing those who do them, Peterson sets housework in a biblical and theological framework that reveals the eternal significance of feeding, clothing, and sheltering others."<br> &#x2014;LaVonne Neff, author, <i>2007: A Book of Grace-Filled Days</i></p> <p>"For many years I have appreciated Margaret's insights and reflections about theology and life. In this book she brings her heart and mind to bear on the subject of housekeeping. The result is a practical and loving look at a routine and demanding practice that can lead&#x2014;believe it or not&#x2014;to contemplation of God."<br> &#x2014;Adele Calhoun, pastor of spiritual formation, Christ Church of Oak Brook, Oak Brook, Illinois; and author, <i>Spiritual Disciplines Handbook</i></p><p>"Keeping house can be a very mundane activity. It is certainly repetitive, and the kinds of work that it involves are varied enough that few people enjoy all of them equally. But at the very same time, housekeeping is about practicing sacred disciplines and creating sacred space, for the sake of Christ as we encounter him in our fellow household members and in neighbors, strangers, and guests."<br> &#x2014;From the Preface</p> <p>Keeping House is a wide-ranging and witty exploration of the spiritual gifts that are gained when we take the time to care for hearth and home. With a fresh perspective, mother, wife, and teacher Margaret Kim Peterson examines the activities and attitudes of keeping house and making a home. Debunking the commonly held notion that keeping house is a waste of time or at best a hobby, Peterson uncovers the broader cultural and theological factors that make housekeeping an interesting and worthwhile discipline. She reveals how the seemingly ordinary tasks of folding laundry, buying groceries, cooking, making beds, and offering hospitality can be seen as spiritual practices that embody and express concrete and positive ways of living out Christian faith in relationship to others at home, in the church, and in the world.</p> <p>Filled with thoughtful reflection and lively anecdotes, Keeping House clearly shows that housekeeping is neither a trivial matter nor simply drudgery. People need to eat, to sleep, to have clothes to wear; they need a place to play, a place into which to welcome guests and from which to go forth into the world. When we are keeping house, we are truly keeping faith.</p></p><h2>Hissy Fit</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Laced with humor and a sense of place that oozes the aroma of magnolia blossoms.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em></p><p>&#x201c;[A] Southern-fried romp.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<em>Entertainment Weekly</em></p><p>Whether it&#x2019;s a mystery, sassy women&#x2019;s fiction, or a combination of the two, <em>New York Times</em> bestseller Mary Kay Andrews always gives her fans a read to remember.

Carr is generally regarded as one of the greatest writers of so-called &#34;Golden Age&#34; mysteries, complex, plot-driven stories in which the puzzle is paramount. He was influenced in this regard by the works of Gaston Leroux and by the Father Brown stories of G. K. Chesterton. He was a master of the locked room mystery, in which a detective solves apparently impossible crimes. He was most famous for his 23 Dr. Fell mysteries. He was also a pioneer of the historical mystery. Dr. Gideon Fell is described as a corpulent man with a moustache who wears a cape and a shovel hat and walks with the aid of two canes. He is frequently described as bringing the spirit of Father Christmas or Old King Cole into a room. In his early appearances he was introduced as a lexicographer but this description gradually disappeared and he was thereafter mostly referred to as working on a monumental history of the beer-drinking habits of the English people. He is an amateur sleuth, frequently called upon by the police, whom he frustrates in the usual manner of most fictional detectives by refusing to reveal his deductions until he has arrived at a complete solution to the problem. Most of Fell&#39;s exploits concern the unraveling of locked room mysteries or of &#34;impossible crimes&#34;. When he himself becomes frustrated, he is likely to cry out, &#34;Archons of Athens!&#34; Dr Fell is supposedly based upon G. K. Chesterton (author of the Father Brown stories), whose physical appearance and personality were similar to those of Doctor Fell. This omnibus contains the complete and unabridged texts of four of the original Dr. Fell editions: To Wake the Dead (1937), The Blind Barber (1934), The Crooked Hinge (1938), and The Case of the Constant Suicides (1941).</p><p></p><h2>Fundamentals of Track and Field, Second Edition</h2><p><p>Teaching correct techniques in track and field can be a challenge, especially for less experienced coaches and physical educators.

It describes three former centers of great wealth, pleasure, and freedom&#x2014;Smyrna, Alexandria, and Beirut&#x2014;cities of the Levant region along the eastern coast of the Mediterranean. In these key ports at the crossroads of East and West, against all expectations, cosmopolitanism and nationalism flourished simultaneously. People freely switched identities and languages, released from the prisons of religion and nationality. Muslims, Christians, and Jews lived and worshipped as neighbors.</p><p>Distinguished historian Philip Mansel is the first to recount the colorful, contradictory histories of Smyrna, Alexandria, and Beirut in the modern age. He begins in the early days of the French alliance with the Ottoman Empire in the sixteenth century and continues through the cities' mid-twentieth-century fates: Smyrna burned; Alexandria Egyptianized; Beirut lacerated by civil war.</p><p>Mansel looks back to discern what these remarkable Levantine cities were like, how they differed from other cities, why they shone forth as cultural beacons. He also embarks on a quest: to discover whether, as often claimed, these cities were truly cosmopolitan, possessing the elixir of coexistence between Muslims, Christians, and Jews for which the world yearns. Or, below the glittering surface, were they volcanoes waiting to erupt, as the catastrophes of the twentieth century suggest? In the pages of the past, Mansel finds important messages for the fractured world of today.</p></p><p><p><b>Philip Mansel</b> is a historian of France and the Ottoman Empire.

It is "a sly paradox of a title," to quote Derek Taylor, The Beatles spokesperson, "chosen by a man concerned for many years and for many reasons to send his ego packing...a book which tells a story of growing up, not necessarily the hard way, but certainly not the easy way." Featuring George Harrison in conversation with Taylor, it touches on everything from early Beatlemania to India and Ravi Shankar to his love of gardening. The lyrics to over 80 of his songs, many in his own hand, are accompanied by his uniquely intimate and humorous commentary. As well, 50 archival photographs of George with the Beatles and solo capture a journey of creative and spiritual transformation. Brimming with the wit, warmth, and grace that characterized his lyrics and his life, <i>I, Me, Mine</i> is a treasured portrait of George Harrison and his music.</p><p>George Harrison (1943-2001) joined The Beatles in 1958 when he was just 15. In addition to his musical career as a solo artist, producer, and member of the Traveling Wilburys, he is remembered as a producer of such films as Monty Python&#39;s Life of Brian. George married Olivia Harrison in 1978.A 400-page memoir from the Quiet Beatle? Can it be? Well, yes and no: only about 60 pages of this earnest tome, originally published in 1980, are devoted to Harrison's recollections of life before, during and (notably) after the Beatles. His memories, which manage to feel fresh and distant at the same time, come to readers via transcripts of his conversations with Derek Taylor (1932-1997), the Beatles press officer and ghostwriter of Brian Epstein's memoir. Harrison (1943-2001) was only in his late 30s when I Me Mine came out-the Beatles had formed, changed music forever and disbanded before his 28th birthday. The rest of this volume consists of photos with whimsical captions ("the author enjoying a cheese sandwich with some friends" is assigned to a picture of Harrison with a sitar) and facsimiles of his handwritten lyrics (including a fairly different version of "Taxman"), each accompanied by a brief explanation (ideas expressed in "It's All Too Much," for example, were inspired by LSD and "confirmed in meditation"). Most of the songs were composed after Harrison's immersion in Hinduism; divorced from their melodies, lyrics espousing love, peace and harmony tend to take on a certain sameness. This volume offers much to Beatles zealots, but for the casual fan, Harrison will likely remain as admirable and as inscrutable as ever.

To understand how this tradition of extraordinary care for our war dead began, Robert Poole traces the founding of Arlington Cemetery on what had been the family plantation of Robert E. Lee. After resigning his commission in the U.S. Army, Lee left Arlington to command the Army of Northern Virginia. Arlington, strategic to the defense of Washington, D.C., became a U.S. Army headquarters and a cemetery for indigent Civil War soldiers before Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton made it the new national cemetery. </p><p>Initially, there was no honor attached to being buried at Arlington; this began to change after the war, as the Union gathered thousands of hastily-buried casualties from nearby battlefields and reinterred them at Arlington, where they received the honors of a grateful nation. But the rites, rituals, and reverence associated with Arlington evolved over the next hundred years, paid through the blood of those who fought in the Spanish-American War, World Wars I and II, the Korean War, the Cold War, Vietnam, Desert Storm, and Iraq and Afghanistan. </p><p>Robert Poole paints an intimate, behind-the-scenes picture of the history and day-to-day operations of Arlington National Cemetery.</p></p><p><p>Robert M.

In his taciturn manner he tells of Arlington Cemetery&#39;s inception during the Civil War. Pilfering the land from the estate of Confederate General Robert E. Lee caused the Union Army no embarrassment. Poole chronicles the evolution of the graveyard in sequence with the conflicts that sent men and women to fill its fields. The services for President Kennedy in 1963 brought such attention to the grounds that many Americans began to aspire to be interred there someday.

The grandson of a slave, he dropped out of high school to become one of the world&#x2019;s most famous musicians, a showman of incomparable suavity who was as comfortable in Carnegie Hall as in the nightclubs where he honed his style. He wrote some fifteen hundred compositions, many of which, like &#x201c;Mood Indigo&#x201d; and &#x201c;Sophisticated Lady,&#x201d; remain beloved standards, and he sought inspiration in an endless string of transient lovers, concealing his inner self behind a smiling mask of flowery language and ironic charm.<br>&nbsp;<br>As the biographer of Louis Armstrong, Terry Teachout is uniquely qualified to tell the story of the public and private lives of Duke Ellington. <i>Duke </i>peels away countless layers of Ellington&#x2019;s evasion and public deception to tell the unvarnished truth about the creative genius who inspired Miles Davis to say, &#x201c;All the musicians should get together one certain day and get down on their knees and thank Duke.&#x201d;</p><p>Terry Teachout, the drama critic at <i>The Wall</i> <i>Street Journal</i>, is the author of <i>Pops: A Life of Louis Armstrong</i> and <i>Satchmo at the Waldorf</i>, a one-man play about Armstrong&#x2019;s life and times. He lives in New York City.&nbsp;<b>From Chapter 5</b><p><i>Black and Tan</i> also marked&#x2014;literally&#x2014;a transition in Ellington&#x2019;s private life. After 1928 his left cheek bore a prominent crescent-shaped scar that is easily visible in the film&#x2019;s last scene (and in the photograph reproduced on the cover of this book). Though rarely mentioned by journalists, it made fans curious enough that he felt obliged to &#x201c;explain&#x201d; its presence in <i>Music Is My Mistress</i>:</p><p><i>I have four stories about it, and it depends on which you like the best. One is a taxicab accident; another is that I slipped and fell on a broken bottle; then there is a jealous woman; and last is Old Heidelberg, where they used to stand toe to toe with a saber in each hand, and slash away. The first man to step back lost the contest, no matter how many times he&#x2019;d sliced the other. Take your pick.</i></p><p>None of Ellington&#x2019;s friends and colleagues was in doubt about which one to pick. In Irving Mills&#x2019;s words, &#x201c;Women was one of the highlights in his life. He had to have women. . . . He always had a woman, always kept a woman here, kept a woman there, always had somebody.&#x201d; Most men who treat women that way are destined to suffer at their hands sooner or later, if not necessarily in so sensational a fashion as Ellington, whose wife attacked him with a razor when she found out that he was sleeping with another woman.</p><p>Who was she? One possible candidate is Fredi Washington. The costar of Black and Tan had launched her theatrical career in 1922 as a dancer in the chorus of the original production of Eubie Blake&#x2019;s <i>Shuffle Along.</i> Sonny Greer later described her as &#x201c;the most beautiful woman&#x201d; he had ever seen. &#x201c;She had gorgeous skin, perfect features, green eyes, and a great figure. When she smiled, that was it!&#x201d; Washington was light enough to pass for white but adamantly refused to do so, a decision that made it impossible for her to establish herself in Hollywood, though she appeared with Paul Robeson in Dudley Murphy&#x2019;s 1933 film of Eugene O&#x2019;Neill&#x2019;s <i>The Emperor Jones</i> (for which her skin was darkened with makeup) and starred in <i>Imitation of Life</i>, a 1934 tearjerker in which she played, with mortifying predictability, a light-skinned black who passed for white. Ellington never spoke on the record about their romantic involvement, but Washington later admitted to the film historian Donald Bogle that she and Ellington had been lovers: &#x201c;I just had to accept that he wasn&#x2019;t going to marry me. But I wasn&#x2019;t going to be his mistress.&#x201d; Their relationship was widely known at the time in the entertainment world, enough so that Mercer Ellington could write in his memoir of &#x201c;a torrid love affair Pop had with a very talented and beautiful woman, an actress. I think this was a genuine romance, that there was love on both sides, and that it amounted to one of the most serious relationships of his life.&#x201d;</p><p>Reprinted by arrangement with GOTHAM BOOKS, a member of Penguin Group (USA) LLC, A Penguin Random House Company.

King has created "lively adventure in the very best of intellectual company," according to <i>The New York Times Book Review.</i> Now the author of <b>The Beekeeper's Apprentice</b> and <b>The Moor</b>--the first writer since Patricia Cornwell to win both the American Edgar and British Creasey Awards for a debut novel (<b>A Grave Talent</b>)--unfolds a hitherto unknown chapter in the history of Russell's apprenticeship to the great detective.<br><br>At the close of the year 1918, forced to flee England's green and pleasant land, Russell and Holmes enter British-occupied Palestine under the auspices of Holmes' enigmatic brother, Mycroft.<br><br>"Gentlemen, we are at your service." Thus Holmes greets the two travel-grimed Arab figures who receive them in the orange groves fringing the Holy Land. Whatever role could the volatile Ali and the taciturn Mahmoud play in Mycroft's design for this land the British so recently wrested from the Turks? After passing a series of tests, Holmes and Russell learn their guides are engaged in a mission for His Majesty's Government, and disguise themselves as Bedouins--Russell as the beardless youth "Amir"--to join them in a stealthy reconnaissance through the dusty countryside.<br><br>A recent rash of murders seems unrelated to the growing tensions between Jew, Moslem, and Christian, yet Holmes is adamant that he must reconstruct the most recent one in the desert gully where it occurred. His singular findings will lead him and Russell through labyrinthine bazaars, verminous inns, cliff-hung monasteries--and into mortal danger. When her mentor's inquiries jeopardize his life, Russell fearlessly wields a pistol and even assays the arts of seduction to save him. Bruised and bloodied, the pair ascend to the jewellike city of Jerusalem, where they will at last meet their adversary, whose lust for savagery and power could reduce the city's most ancient and sacred place to rubble and ignite this tinderbox of a land....<br><br>Classically Holmesian yet enchantingly fresh, sinuously plotted, with colorful characters and a dazzling historic ambience, <b>O Jerusalem</b> sweeps readers ever onward in the thrill of the chase.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>Although <i>O Jerusalem</i> is Laurie King's fifth book in her Holmes-Russell series, it actually takes us back to the era of her first book, <i>The Beekeeper's Apprentice</i>. Perhaps King was afraid that her characters, Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes, were becoming too cozy as an old married couple, and she wanted to recreate the edgy sexual tension of their first encounter. <p> It's 1918. Nineteen-year-old Mary and her fiftysomething mentor are forced to flee England to escape a deadly adversary. Sherlock's well-connected brother Mycroft sends them to Palestine to do some international sleuthing. Here, a series of murders threatens the fragile peace. </p><p> Laurie King connects us, through details of language, custom, history, and sensual impressions, to this very alien environment. Russell, Holmes, and two marvelously imagined Arab guides named Mahmoud and Ali trek through the desert and visit ancient monasteries clinging like anthills to cliffs. They also find time to take tea with the British military legend Allenby in Haifa and skulk through or under the streets of Jerusalem. King puts us into each scene so quickly and completely that her narrative flow never falters.</p><p> Stepping back in time also gives King a chance to show us Holmes through the eyes of a Russell not yet as full of love as a honeymooner, nor as complacent as a comfortable wife. "There it was--sardonic, superior, infuriating," Mary says about Holmes's voice at one point. </p><p> Wisdom is knowing when, and how much, to shake things up--even in a successful series.

Derided as &#x201c;infidels&#x201d; and &#x201c;atheists&#x201d; in their own time, they wanted to liberate us not just from one king but from the tyranny of supernatural religion. <p>The ideas that inspired them were neither British nor Christian but largely ancient, pagan, and continental: the fecund universe of the Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius, the potent (but nontranscendent) natural divinity of the Dutch heretic Benedict de Spinoza. Drawing deeply on the study of European philosophy, Matthew Stewart pursues a genealogy of the philosophical ideas from which America&#x2019;s revolutionaries drew their inspiration, all scrupulously researched and documented and enlivened with storytelling of the highest order. Along the way, he uncovers the true meanings of &#x201c;Nature&#x2019;s God,&#x201d; &#x201c;self-evident,&#x201d; and many other phrases crucial to our understanding of the American experiment but now widely misunderstood.</p><p>Stewart&#x2019;s lucid and passionate investigation surprises, challenges, enlightens, and entertains at every turn, as it spins a true tale and a persuasive, exhilarating argument about the founding principles of American government and the sources of our success in science, medicine, and the arts.</p></p><p>Matthew Stewart is the author of Nature&#39;s God: The Heretical Origins of the American Republic, The Courtier and the Heretic: Leibniz, Spinoza, and the Fate of God in the Modern World and The Management Myth: Debunking the Modern Philosophy of Business. He lives in Boston, Massachusetts.&#x201c;Matthew Stewart&#x2019;s brilliant new book breathes fresh life into our understanding of the American Revolution. Beautifully written and lucidly argued, <em>Nature&#x2019;s God</em> recovers the lost voices and original intentions of the thoughtful men who made America. Sure to stir controversy on all fronts, <em>Nature&#x2019;s God</em> will set the agenda for serious discussion of the American Revolution&#x2019;s significance in world history.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Peter S. Onuf, author of <em>The Mind of Thomas Jefferson</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Splendid...imaginative but never fanciful, even at its most surprising. What lends <em>Nature&#x2019;s God</em> a good deal of its verve is Matthew Stewart&#x2019;s unabashed attachment not only to the revolutionaries as they really were but to the skeptical rationalism they embodied. This is partisan scholarship as it should be written, and much needed service to the public.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Alan Ryan, author of <em>The Making of Modern Liberalism</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In a book that offers you a chance to rethink much of what you thought you knew about America&#x2019;s founders, Matthew Stewart traces the little-known influence of secular philosophers, from Epicurus through Spinoza, on the revolutionary generation and offers a lively, powerful, and erudite refutation of the myth that the framers of our secular Constitution had any intention of founding an orthodox Christian nation.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Susan Jacoby, author of <em>Freethinkers: A History of American Secularism</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Eloquently argued.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Wendy Smith, <em>Los Angeles Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Enthralling and important ...

Islamic prophecy also predicts that a man will rise up to lead the nations, pledging to usher in an era of peace. Islam&#x2019;s savior is called the Mahdi. However, the man in the Bible is the Antichrist. Joel Richardson&#x2019;s stunning research and analysis suggest the Mahdi and the Antichrist may actually be one and the same. In The Islamic Antichrist, Richardson exposes Western readers to the traditions of Islam and predicts the end times may not be here. Richardson&#x2019;s revelations will stun readers who are unaware of the similarities between the Antichrist and the Islam&#x2019;s expectations about a returning Jesus. His explanation of the relationship between Christian end-time prophecy and Islamic expectations of world domination has shocked readers and revolutionized eschatological expectations for a generation.

As Evan Thomas (<i>The Wise Men</i> and <i>Man to See</i>) writes, both liberals and conservatives have their own spin on his legacy, with predictably different visions of what he would have done if he had lived to be our 37th president. As it turns out, none of the Good Bobby/Bad Bobby projections are right, and none are completely wrong either. In sorting through the myths and the truths, Evans provides a detailed portrait of a man centrally engaged in most of the important issues of the postwar era, and concludes that the best way to understand him is "fear":<p> </p><blockquote>He was brave because he was afraid. His monsters were too large and close at hand to simply flee. He had to turn and fight them.... He became a one-man underground, honeycombed with hidden passages, speaking in code, trusting no one completely, ready to face the firing squad--but also knowing when to slip away to fight again another day. Although he affected simplicity and directness, he became an extraordinarily complicated and subtle man. His shaking hands and reedy voice, his groping for words as well as meaning, his occasional resort to subterfuge, do not diminish his daring. Precisely because he was fearful and self-doubting, his story is an epic of courage. </blockquote><p> RFK was born after the chosen siblings had been established in the Kennedy clan. He originally had low standing in the family hierarchy. Evans describes how the "runt" of the family, the one not born and raised for power and whose only ambition was to please the father who ignored him, turned into the essential son, the defender of the family and mediator between Joe Sr. and JFK. He fleshes out Bobby's role in JFK's campaigns, his testy relations with Martin Luther King, his middle-ground stance on integration, his performance during the Cuban missile crisis, and his genuine concern for the poor. He reveals the truth behind such events as the vice-presidential appointment of Lyndon Johnson as well as the famous calls from the Kennedy brothers, which got Martin Luther King out of jail. He also tries to untangle the webs obscuring the Kennedys' involvement in Castro assassination plots, their relations with Marilyn Monroe, and RFK's guilt over his brother's death. And finally, he, too, speculates on what kind of president one of history's great what-ifs might have made. The picture he paints--of a sensitive, courageous, and determined man on the verge of achieving greatness--is more complex and human than any we've had before, and reminds us again of the tragedy of his death. --<i>Lesley Reed</i></p><b>Evan Thomas</b> is Assistant Managing Editor of <i>Newsweek</i> in Washington, D.C.

The brightness intruded, grew, made him blink groggily. A window was open, letting in mild afternoon air and a freshwater smell. Not Camorr. Sound of waves lapping against a sand beach. Not Camorr <br>at all.<br>He was tangled in his sheets again, light-headed. The roof of his mouth felt like sun--dried leather. Chapped lips peeled apart as he croaked, &#x201c;What are you&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Shhhh. I didn&#x2019;t mean to wake you. The room needed some air.&#x201d; A dark blur on the left, more or less Jean&#x2019;s height. The floor creaked as the shape moved about. Soft rustle of fabric, snap of a coin purse, clink of metal. Locke pushed himself up on his elbows, prepared for the dizziness. It came on punctually.<br>&#x201c;I was dreaming about her,&#x201d; he muttered. &#x201c;The times that we&nbsp;. . . when we first met.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Her?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Her. You know.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ah. The canonical her.&#x201d; Jean knelt beside the bed and held out a cup of water, which Locke took in his shaking left hand and sipped at gratefully. The world was slowly coming into focus.<br>&#x201c;So vivid,&#x201d; said Locke. &#x201c;Thought I could touch her. Tell her&nbsp;. . . how sorry I am.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the best you can manage?

Making my rounds.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Jean, there&#x2019;s no point. Quit torturing yourself.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Finished?&#x201d; Jean took the empty cup from him.<br>&#x201c;Not nearly. I&#x2014;-&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Won&#x2019;t be gone long.&#x201d; Jean set the cup on the table and gave the lapels of his coat a perfunctory brushing as he moved to the door. &#x201c;Get some more rest.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t bloody listen to reason, do you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You know what they say about imitation and flattery.&#x201d;<br>The door slid shut and Jean was gone, out into the streets of La-<br>shain.<br>2<br>Lashain was famous as a city where anything could be bought and anything could be left behind. By the grace of the regio, the city&#x2019;s highest and thinnest order of nobility (where a title that could be traced back more than two generations qualified one for the old guard), just about anyone with cash in hand and enough of a pulse to maintain semiconsciousness could have their blood transmuted to a reasonable facsimile of blue.<br>From every corner of the Therin world they came&#x2014;-merchants and criminals, mercenary captains and pirates, gamblers and adventurers and exiles. As commoners they entered the chrysalis of a countinghouse, shed vast quantities of precious metal, and as newborn peers of Lashain they emerged into daylight. The regio minted demibarons, barons, viscounts, counts, and even the occasional marquis, with styles largely of their own invention. Honors were taken from a list and cost extra; &#x201c;Defender of the Twelvefold Faith&#x201d; was quite popular. There were also half a dozen meaningless orders of knighthood that looked marvelous on a coat lapel.<br>Because of the novelty of this purchased respectability to those who brokered it for themselves, Lashain was the most violently manners--conscious city Jean Tannen had ever visited. Lacking centuries of aristocratic descent to assure them of their worth, the neophytes of Lashain overcompensated with ceremony. Their rules of precedence were like alchemical formulae, and dinner parties killed more of them each year than fevers and accidents combined. It seemed that little could be more thrilling for those who&#x2019;d just bought their family names than to risk them (not to mention their mortal flesh) over minor insults.<br>The record, as far as Jean had heard, was three days from counting--house to dueling green to funeral cart. The regio, of course, offered no refunds to relations of the deceased.<br>As a result of this nonsense, it was difficult for those without titles, regardless of the color of their coin, to gain ready access to the city&#x2019;s best physikers. They were made such status symbols by their noble clients that they rarely had to scamper after gold from other sources.<br>The taste of autumn was in the cool wind blowing off the Amathel, the Lake of Jewels&#x2014;-the freshwater sea that rolled to the horizon north of Lashain. Jean was conservatively dressed by local standards, in a brown velvet frock coat and silks worth no more than, say, three months&#x2019; wages for an average tradesman. This marked him instantly as someone&#x2019;s man and suited his current task. No gentleman of consequence did his own waiting at a physiker&#x2019;s garden gate.<br>Scholar Erkemar Zodesti was regarded as the finest physiker in Lashain, a prodigy with the bone saw and the alchemist&#x2019;s crucible. He&#x2019;d also shown complete disinterest, for three days straight, in Jean&#x2019;s requests for a consultation.<br>Today Jean once again approached the iron--barred gate at the rear of Zodesti&#x2019;s garden, from behind which an elderly servant peered at him with reptilian insolence. In Jean&#x2019;s outstretched hand was a parchment envelope and a square of white card, just like the three days previous. Jean was getting testy.<br>The servant reached between the bars without a word and took everything Jean offered. The envelope, containing the customary gratuity of (far too many) silver coins, vanished into the servant&#x2019;s coat. The old man read or pretended to read the white card, raised his eyebrows at Jean, and walked away.<br>The card said exactly what it always did&#x2014;-Contempla va cora frata eminenza. &#x201c;Consider the request of an eminent friend,&#x201d; in the Throne Therin that was the polite affectation for this sort of gesture. Rather than giving an aristocrat&#x2019;s name, this message meant that someone powerful wished to pay anonymously to have someone else examined. This was a common means of bringing wealth to bear on the problem of, say, a pregnant mistress, without directly compromising the identity of anyone important.<br>Jean passed the long minutes of his wait by examining the physiker&#x2019;s house. It was a good solid place, about the size of a smaller Alcegrante mansion back in Camorr. Newer, though, and done up in a mock Tal Verrar style that labored to proclaim the importance of its inhabitants. The roof was tiled with slats of volcanic glass, and the windows bordered with decorative carvings that would have better suited a temple.<br>From the heart of the garden itself, closed off from view by a ten--foot stone wall, Jean could hear the sounds of a lively party. Clinking glasses, shrieks of laughter, and behind it all the hum of a nine--stringed viol and a few other instruments.<br>&#x201c;I regret to inform your master that the scholar is presently unable to accommodate his request for a consultation.&#x201d; The servant reappeared behind the iron gate with empty hands. The envelope, a token of earnestness, was of course gone. Whether into the hands of Zodesti or this servant, Jean couldn&#x2019;t say.<br>&#x201c;Perhaps you might tell me when it would be more convenient for the scholar to receive my master&#x2019;s petition,&#x201d; said Jean, &#x201c;the middle of the afternoon for half a week now being obviously unsuitable.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t say.&#x201d; The servant yawned. &#x201c;The scholar is consumed with work.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;With work.&#x201d; Jean fumed as the sound of applause drifted from the garden party. &#x201c;Indeed. My master has a case which requires the greatest possible skill and discretion&#x2014;-&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Your master could rely upon the scholar&#x2019;s discretion at all times,&#x201d; said the servant. &#x201c;Unfortunately, his skill is urgently required elsewhere at the moment.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Gods damn you, man!&#x201d; Jean&#x2019;s self--control evaporated. &#x201c;This is important!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I will not be spoken to in a vulgar fashion. Good day.&#x201d;<br>Jean considered reaching through the iron bars and seizing the old man by the throat, but that would have been counter-productive. He wore no fighting leathers under his finery, and his decorative shoes would be worse than bare feet in a scuffle. Despite the pair of hatchets tucked away under his coat, he wasn&#x2019;t equipped to storm even a garden party by choice.<br>&#x201c;The scholar risks giving offense to a citizen of considerable importance,&#x201d; growled Jean.<br>&#x201c;The scholar is giving offense, you simple fellow.&#x201d; The old man chuckled. &#x201c;I tell you plainly, he has little interest in the sort of business arranged in this fashion. I don&#x2019;t believe a single citizen of quality is so unfamiliar with the scholar that they need fear to be received by the front door.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call again tomorrow,&#x201d; said Jean, straining to keep his composure. &#x201c;Perhaps I might name a sum that will penetrate even your master&#x2019;s indifference.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You are to be commended for your persistence, if not for your perception. Tomorrow you must do as your master bids. For now, I have already said good day.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Good day,&#x201d; growled Jean. &#x201c;May the gods cherish the house wherein such kindness dwells.&#x201d; He bowed stiffly and left.<br>There was nothing else to be done at the moment, in this gods--damned city where even throwing envelopes of coins was no guarantee of attracting attention to a problem.<br>As he stomped back to his hired carriage, Jean cursed Maxilan Stragos for the thousandth time. The bastard had lied about so much. Why, in the end, had the damned poison been the one thing he&#x2019;d chosen to tell the truth about?<br>3<br>Home for the time being was a rented suite in the Villa Suvela, an unadorned but scrupulously clean rooming house favored by travelers who came to Lashain to take the waters of the Amathel. Those waters were said to cure rheumatism, though Jean had yet to see a bather emerge leaping and dancing. The rooming house overlooked a black sand beach on the city&#x2019;s northeast shore, and the other lodgers kept to themselves.<br>&#x201c;The bastard,&#x201d; said Jean as he threw open the door to the suite&#x2019;s inner apartment. &#x201c;The motherless Lashani reptile. The greedy son of a piss--bucket and a bad fart.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;My keen grasp of subtle nuance tells me you might be frustrated,&#x201d; said Locke. He was sitting up, and he looked fully awake.<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been snobbed off again,&#x201d; said Jean, frowning. Despite the fresh air from the window the inner apartment still smelled of old sweat and fresh blood. &#x201c;Zodesti won&#x2019;t come. Not today, at least.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;To hell with him, then, Jean.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s the only physiker of repute I haven&#x2019;t got to yet. Some of the others were difficult, but he&#x2019;s being impossible.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been pinched and bled by every gods--damned lunatic in this city who ever shoved a bolus down a throat,&#x201d; said Locke. &#x201c;One more hardly signifies.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s the best.&#x201d; Jean flung his coat over a chair, set his hatchets down, and removed a bottle of blue wine from a cabinet. &#x201c;An alchemical expert. A real smirking rat--fucker, too.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all for the good, then,&#x201d; said Locke. &#x201c;What would the neighbors say if I consulted a man who screws rodents?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We need his opinion.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m tired of being a medical curiosity,&#x201d; said Locke. &#x201c;If he won&#x2019;t come, he won&#x2019;t come.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call again tomorrow.&#x201d; Jean poured two half--glasses of wine and watered them until they were a pleasant afternoon--sky color. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have the self--important prick here one way or another.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What would you do, break his fingers if he won&#x2019;t consult? Might make things ticklish for me. Especially if he wants to cut something off.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He might find a solution.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, for the gods&#x2019; sake.&#x201d; Locke&#x2019;s frustrated sigh turned into a cough. &#x201c;There is no solution.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Trust me. Tomorrow is going to be one of my unusually persuasive days.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;As I see it, it&#x2019;s cost us only a few pieces of gold to discover how unfashionable we are. Most social failures incur far greater expense, I should think.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Somewhere out there,&#x201d; said Jean, &#x201c;must be an illness that makes its sufferers meek, mild, and agreeable. I&#x2019;ll find it someday, and see that you get the worst possible case.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure I was born immune. Speaking of agreeable, will that wine be arriving in my hands any time this year?&#x201d;<br>Locke had seemed alert enough, but his voice was slurring, and weaker than it had been even the day before. Jean approached the bed uneasily, wineglasses held out like a peace offering to some unfamiliar and potentially dangerous creature.<br>Locke had been in this condition before, too thin and too pale, with weeks of beard on his cheeks. Only this time there was no obvious wound to tend, no cuts to bandage. Just Maxilan Stragos&#x2019; insidious legacy doing its silent work. Locke&#x2019;s sheets were spotted with blood and with the dark stains of fever--sweat. His eyes gleamed in bruised sockets.<br>Jean pored over a pile of medical texts each night, and still he didn&#x2019;t have adequate words for what was happening to Locke. He was being unknit from the inside; his veins and sinews were coming apart. Blood seeped out of him as though by some demonic whim. One hour he might cough it up, the next it would come from his eyes or nose.<br>&#x201c;Gods damn it,&#x201d; Jean whispered as Locke reached for the wineglass. Locke&#x2019;s left hand was red with blood, as though his fingers had been dipped in it. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s this?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nothing unusual.&#x201d; Locke chuckled. &#x201c;It started up while you were gone&nbsp;. . . from under my nails. Here, I can hold the glass with my other one&#x2014;-&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Were you trying to hide it from me? Who else changes your gods--damned sheets?&#x201d;<br>Jean set the glasses down and moved to the table beneath the window, which held stacks of linen towels, a water jug, and a washing bowl. The bowl&#x2019;s water was rusty with old blood.<br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t hurt, Jean,&#x201d; muttered Locke.<br>Ignoring him, Jean picked up the bowl. The window overlooked the villa&#x2019;s interior courtyard, which was fortunately deserted. Jean heaved the old bloody water out the window, refilled the bowl from the jug, and dipped a linen cloth into it.<br>&#x201c;Hand,&#x201d; said Jean. Locke sulkily complied, and Jean molded the wet cloth around his fingers. It turned pink. &#x201c;Keep it elevated for a while.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I know it looks bad, but it&#x2019;s really not that much blood.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve little left to lose!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m also in want of wine.&#x201d;<br>Jean fetched their glasses again and carefully placed one in Locke&#x2019;s right hand. Locke&#x2019;s shakes didn&#x2019;t seem too bad for the moment, which was pleasing. He&#x2019;d had difficulty holding things lately.<br>&#x201c;A toast,&#x201d; said Locke. &#x201c;To alchemists. May they all be stricken with the screaming fire--shits.&#x201d; He sipped his wine. &#x201c;Or strangled in bed. Whatever&#x2019;s most convenient. I&#x2019;m not picky.&#x201d;<br>At his next sip, he coughed, and a ruby--colored droplet spiraled down into his wine, leaving a purplish tail as it dissolved.<br>&#x201c;Gods,&#x201d; said Jean. He gulped the rest of his own wine and set the glass aside. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going out to fetch Malcor.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Jean, I don&#x2019;t need another damned dog--leech at the moment. He&#x2019;s been here six or seven times already. Why&#x2014;-&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Something might have changed. Something might be different.&#x201d; Jean grabbed his coat. &#x201c;Maybe he can help the bleeding. Maybe he&#x2019;ll finally find some clue&#x2014;-&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There is no clue, Jean. There&#x2019;s no antidote that&#x2019;s going to spring from Malcor or Kepira or Zodesti or any boil--lancing fraud in this whole tedious shitsack of a cit...</p><h2>MARVEL KNIGHTS PUNISHER BY GARTH ENNIS: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION VOL. 3</h2><p>The Marvel Knights era of Punisher comes to an explosive close!

As a lawyer in East Harlem, he saw the social injustice; and, in his writings as well as his activism, he tried to indicate the ways Christianity could respond to those injustices. Stringfellow&#39;s writings are deeply scriptural, and this collection, drawn from his 16 books and numerous articles, nicely demonstrates the wide range of his thoughts and passions. The first section focuses on his autobiographical writings; the second collects his words on the vocation of the church; and a third is devoted to his central theological concern, the conflict of principalities and powers. The final section collects writings devoted to the art of living humanely.

He lives in Berlin. Shelley Frisch teaches German language and literature at Rutgers University.This book is not a traditional philosopher's biography offering an even balance of life and thought, but rather a rich interpretation of Nietzsche's philosophy as it evolved during his life, with a coda tracing his influence after his death. Biographical details are sparing: neither Nietzsche's birth nor death is described, and there are few juicy bits about his passion for Lou Salom�. Most of the book is a reading of Nietzsche's developing ideas, beginning with his autobiographical sketches in high school and continuing chronologically from his early attachment to Schopenhauer through his hopes for and disappointment in Wagner's music drama, such great achievements as Daybreak and Thus Spoke Zarathustra, and his last works before his descent into madness. To close, there is a chapter on the different ways Nietzsche influenced 20th-century artists, the Nazis, Heidegger, Foucault, Rorty and others. Throughout, certain themes recur, elucidated sympathetically but with "ironic reserve," including the death of God, the divided self, the will to power, eternal recurrence, philosophy as art and truth as power play. Safranski (Heidegger: Between Good and Evil), in clear English from Rutgers University Germanist Frisch, brings out contradictions and tensions in Nietzsche's thought without dismissing him; on the contrary, Safranski sees Nietzsche as a thinker "who organized his gardens of theory in such a way that anyone on the lookout for their central arguments would almost inevitably fall flat on his face," but who leads one to return profitably to "[o]ne's own thinking." The author offers no summary conclusions, preferring to leave Nietzsche's philosophical biography open, as "a story without an end." Safranski has made a worthwhile contribution to that story, though it will be of interest mainly to those with an interest in engaging the work directly. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Guide to Moab, UT Backroads &amp; 4-Wheel Drive Trails</h2><p>This book has been completely redone.

Unhappy about the slow results and prompted by the elderly residents of the resort, she consults the local witch for help. Agatha purchases a hair tonic (and a love potion, just in case!) and is soon sprouting hairs and capturing the fancy of the village police inspector.

Can she still find a way to make the holidays bright?</p><p>Grade 2-4-Set in Cincinnati, OH, during the Great Depression, these books introduce fourth-grade Kit. In Meet Kit, her father must close his car dealership and join the large number of unemployed. In an effort to make ends meet, her mother takes in boarders; Mrs. Howard and her son Stirling settle into Kit's newly redecorated bedroom, while the girl makes the best of her new space in the attic. In Kit Learns a Lesson, her older brother gets a job rather than attend college, and Kit helps her mother clean. Additional boarders have moved in and there is more work than ever. When a classmate's taunts lead to an altercation, Stirling, Kit, and her best friend are punished. They must deliver food collected by the students to the local soup kitchen, and Kit is shocked to see her father on line for lunch. Still, this is a somewhat idealized portrayal of the Depression.

Hirschman here offers a new interpretation for the rise of capitalism, one that emphasizes the continuities between old and new, in contrast to the assumption of a sharp break that is a common feature of both Marxian and Weberian thinking. Among the insights presented here is the ironical finding that capitalism was originally supposed to accomplish exactly what was soon denounced as its worst feature: the repression of the passions in favor of the "harmless," if one-dimensional, interests of commercial life. To portray this lengthy ideological change as an endogenous process, Hirschman draws on the writings of a large number of thinkers, including Montesquieu, Sir James Steuart, and Adam Smith.</p><br><p> Featuring a new afterword by Jeremy Adelman and a foreword by Amartya Sen, this Princeton Classics edition of <i>The Passions and the Interests</i> sheds light on the intricate ideological transformation from which capitalism emerged triumphant, and reaffirms Hirschman's stature as one of our most influential and provocative thinkers.</p></p><p><b>Albert O.

Reprint. 25,000 first printing.</p><p><p><em>Do miracles really happen? Can we know if the supernatural world exists?</em> "The central miracle asserted by Christians is the Incarnation. They say that God became Man. Every other miracle prepares the way for this, or results from this." In <em>Miracles</em>, C. S. Lewis takes this key idea and shows that a Christian must not only accept but rejoice in miracles as a testimony of the unique personal involvement of God in creation. Using his characteristic warmth, lucidity, and wit, Lewis challenges the rationalists and cynics who are mired in their lack of imagination and provides a poetic and joyous affirmation that miracles really do occur in everyday lives.</p>Clive Staples Lewis (1898-1963) was one of the intellectual giants of the twentieth century.

This isn't just a hunch--we know this because we asked! When the Rodale quilt editors surveyed quilters to find the tops they wanted to learn about, this duo was at the top of the list. Figuring out the most pleasing way to arrange the blocks together and then deciding what sort of border to use to finish the whole arrangement are not matters to take lightly. These two decisions affect how successful your finished quilt will be. But we noticed that there are very few books that help quilters explore all the creative setting and border possibilities, how to choose the best one for a particular quilt, and then how to actually sit down at the sewing machine and make it all happen. There's a big gap in setting and border information, and we decided to fill it!</p><p>Working as the editor on this book was doubly exciting because I love working with borders, plus I've always wanted to explore setting options that go beyond the ordinary. I've been a quiltmaker for more than 25 years now, and I've added a lot of borders to quilts. When I first started quilting, I figured that all you had to do was cut a strop of fabric, sew it to the edge of the quilt, and trim off what was left over. As a result, many of my early quilts have very wavy borders, and no, the fullness often didn't quilt out. But once I learned the very simple basics of fitting borders to quilts, my finished pieces became much flatter, making them easier to baste, quilt, and bind.</p><b>Sally Schneider</b> has been a quilter for more than twenty-five years and a quilting teacher for fifteen years.

Now, <i>I Need Your Love</i>&#x2014;<i>Is That True?</i> examines a universal, age-old source of anxiety: our relationships with others. In this groundbreaking book, Katie helps you question everything you have been taught to do to gain love and approval. In doing this, you discover how to find genuine love and connection. <br><br>The usual advice offered in self-help books and reinforced by our culture advocates a stressful, all-consuming quest for love and approval. We are advised to learn self-marketing and manipulative skills&#x2014;how to attract, impress, seduce, and often pretend to be something we aren&#x2019;t. This approach doesn&#x2019;t work. It leaves millions of walking wounded&#x2014;those who, having failed to find love or appreciation, blame themselves and conclude that they are unworthy of love. <br><br><i>I Need Your Love</i>&#x2014;<i>Is That True?</i> helps you illuminate every area in your life where you seem to lack what you long for most&#x2014;the love of your spouse, the respect of your child, a lover&#x2019;s tenderness, or the esteem of your boss. Through its penetrating inquiry, you will quickly discover the falseness of the accepted ways of seeking love and approval, and also of the mythology that equates love with need. Using the method in this book, you will inquire into painful beliefs that you&#x2019;ve based your whole life on&#x2014;and be delighted to see them evaporate. Katie shows you how unraveling the knots in the search for love, approval, and appreciation brings real love and puts you in charge of your own happiness.<br>&#x201c;Everyone agrees that love is wonderful, except when it&#x2019;s terrible. People spend their whole lives tantalized by love&#x2014;seeking it, trying to hold on to it, or trying to get over it. Not far behind love, as major preoccupations, come approval and appreciation. From childhood on, most people spend much of their energy in a relentless pursuit of these things, trying out different methods to be noticed, to please, to impress, and to win other people&#x2019;s love, thinking that&#x2019;s just the way life is. This effort can become so constant and unquestioned that we barely notice it anymore.<br><br>This book takes a close look at what works and what doesn&#x2019;t in the quest for love and approval. It will help you find a way to be happier in love and more effective in all your relationships. What you learn here will bring fulfillment to all kinds of relationships, including romantic love, dating, marriage, work, and friendship.&#x201d; &#x2014;Byron Katie</p><p>Byron Katie (she was born Byron Kathleen Reid, and everyone calls her Katie) discovered inquiry in 1986. Everything in this book comes from The Work of Byron Katie, her remarkable method for finding happiness and freedom. Katie has been traveling around the world for more than a dozen years teaching The Work directly to hundreds of thousands of people. In addition, she has introduced The Work into business settings, universities, schools, churches, prisons, and hospitals.

Or that seeking approval makes you feel insecure? If you have, there's a reason. It's because seeking love and approval is a sure way to lose the awareness of both. You can lose the awareness of love, but never love itself. Love is what we are. So, if love is what we are, why do we look for it so hard, and often with such poor results? Only because of what we think&#x2014;the thoughts we believe that are not true.<br><br>You don't have to believe any of this. You can verify it for yourself as you read this book or when you put the book down and ask four questions about your own relationships, or lack of them, and discover how your life changes.<br><br>In the pursuit of love, approval, and appreciation, what do we think? We think that the love and approval of others are the keys to the kingdom&#x2014;to every good thing in the world. We think that seeking romance brings love, a sexual partner, long-term closeness, marriage, family. And we think that trying to impress society&#x2014;trying to win the admiration of the right people&#x2014;is our best shot at bringing fame, wealth, and satisfaction into our lives.<br><br>So we think that if we succeed in the quest, we're home: safe, warm, and appreciated. And what if we fail? We're homeless, out in the cold, lost in the crowd, unnoticed, lonely, and forgotten. If those are the stakes, no wonder the quest can be so fearful and all-consuming. No wonder a compliment can make your day and a harsh word can ruin it.<br><br>The big, primitive fears rarely rise to the surface. Few people walk around actually thinking that they're about to fall through the cracks of society and vanish. Instead, thousands of anxious thoughts appear all day long: "Was I noticed?" "Why didn't she smile?" "Did I make a good impression?" "Why hasn't he returned my call?" "Do I look okay?" "Should I have said that?" "What do they think of me now?" It's a constant monitoring to see if we're gaining or losing ground in the grand approval sweepstakes. Those little doubts are rarely noticed or questioned, and yet they set in motion hundreds of strategies designed to win favor and admiration, or just to please. The unspoken belief is that unless people approve of you, you're worthless.<br><br>The irony is that the struggle to win love and approval makes it very difficult to experience them. Chronic approval seekers don't realize that they are loved and supported not because of but despite their efforts. And the more strenuously they seek, the less likely they are to notice.<br><br>How do we get into this predicament? For a few pages, we'll just look at the ways unquestioned thoughts create our experience. We'll see how often-unnoticed thoughts that most of us share lead us to needing, wanting, longing, and reaching for what we already have. The thoughts behind a familiar 3 a.m. anxiety attack are a good place to start.<br><br>Thought at 3 a.m.: Nothing Supports Me<br><br>Suddenly you wake up in the middle of the night, glance at the clock, and wish you were still asleep. A thought appears: "What's going to happen to me? It's a cold, uncaring universe. I don't know what to do." These thoughts were triggered by a mutual-fund commercial you saw last night, but you don't realize that. And the next ones come from a half-remembered motivational tape: "There are no guarantees in this world. Nothing's going to happen for you unless you make it happen." This thought provides a little boost, followed by a major deflation as you remember that self-reliance hasn't worked all that well for you. "I need so much. I have so few resources to get it. My survival skills aren't great, and basically I'm faking it. I'm helpless and alone. " The next thought brings some hope: "If I could just get more love from my family and friends, if just one person really adored me, if my boss really believed in me, then I wouldn't be so anxious, and I could count on being supported."<br><br>The thought "Nothing supports me without my efforts" is just one of the unquestioned and often unnoticed beliefs that set in motion the search for love and approval. Let's pause for a moment and explore the opposite.<br><br>Daylight Reality Check:Everything Supports Me<br><br>Do you know what supports your existence right now?<br><br>Just to scratch the surface of this, suppose you've eaten your breakfast, sat down in your favorite chair, and picked up this book. Your neck and shoulders support your head. The bones and muscles of your chest support your breathing. Your chair supports your body. The floor supports your chair. The earth supports the building you live in. Various stars and planets hold the earth in its orbit. Outside your window a man walks down the street with his dog. Can you be sure that he isn't playing a part in your support? He may work every day in a cubicle, filing papers for the power company that makes your lights come on.<br><br>Among the people you see on the street, and the countless hands and eyes working behind the scenes, can you be sure that there is anyone who isn't supporting your existence? The same question applies to the generations of ancestors who preceded you and to the various plants and animals that had something to do with your breakfast. How many unlikely coincidences allow you to be here!<br><br>To explore this for a while, look around and see if there is anything you can say for sure doesn't play some role in supporting you. Now look again at the 3 a.m. thought "Nothing supports me without my efforts." In this moment wouldn't it be more true to say, "Everything supports me without my efforts"? The proof is that here you are, sitting in your chair, doing nothing, being fully supported.<br><br>Everything supports you whether or not you even notice it, whether or not you think about it or understand it, whether you love it or hate it, whether you're happy or sad, asleep or awake, motivated or unmotivated. It just supports you without asking for anything in return.<br><br>Right now, sitting in your chair, as you breathe, notice that you're not doing the breathing, you're being breathed. You don't even have to be aware of it, you don't even have to remember to breathe, because that is supported too. Complicated and intricate as your requirements for existence might be, they are all being met. At this moment there's nothing you need, nothing you need to do. Notice how it feels to take in that thought.<br><br>Now think of something you don't have. I'm sure you can think of something. . .<br><br><i>The Thought That Kicks You Out of Heaven</i><br><br>The thought that kicks you out of heaven could be "I'd be a little more comfortable if I had a pillow." Or it could be "I'd be happier if my partner were here."<br><br>Without that thought, you're in heaven&#x2014;just sitting in your chair, being supported and being breathed. When you believe the thought that something is missing, what do you experience? The immediate effect may be subtle&#x2014;only a slight restlessness as your attention moves away from what you already have. But with that shift of attention, you give up the peace you have as you sit in your chair. Seeking comfort, you give yourself discomfort.<br><br>What if you did get a pillow? That could work (if you have a pillow). You may find yourself back in heaven again. It may be the very thing you needed. Or you could pick up the phone and convince your partner (if you have a partner) to join you, and maybe he or she would actually arrive. And perhaps you would be happier, and perhaps you wouldn't. In the meantime, there goes your peace.<br><br>The thought that kicks you out of heaven doesn't have to be about comfort or happiness. It could be "I'd be more secure if . . ." or "If only it could always be like this," or it could be just the thought of a cup of coffee. Most people are so busy making improvements they don't notice they've stepped out of heaven. Wherever they are, something or someone could always be better.<br><br>So, how do you get back to heaven? To begin with, just notice the thoughts that take you away from it. You don't have to believe everything your thoughts tell you. Just become familiar with the particular thoughts you use to deprive yourself of happiness. It may seem strange at first to get to know yourself in this way, but becoming familiar with your stressful thoughts will show you the way home to everything you need.<br><br><i>Getting to Know You</i><br><br>When you begin to notice your thoughts, one of the first things you'll see is that you're never alone. You're not alone with your lover or with anyone else; you're not even alone with yourself. Wherever you go, whomever you're with, the voice in your head goes with you, whispering, nagging, enticing, judging, chattering, shaming, guilt-tripping, or yelling at you. When you wake up in the morning, your thoughts wake up with you. They push you out of bed and follow you to work. They make comments about people at the office and people in the store. They follow you to the bathroom, get into your car when you do, and come back home again with you. Whether or not someone is waiting for you at home, your thoughts will be there waiting for you.<br><br>If you're afraid to be alone, it means you're afraid of your thoughts. If you loved your thoughts, you would love to be alone anywhere with them; you wouldn't have to turn on the radio when you get in the car, or the TV when you get home. The way you relate to your thoughts&#x2014;that's what you bring to every relationship you have, including the one with yourself.<br><br><i>But Wait a Minute!</i><br><br>You may be asking: "That voice in my head, isn't it me? Don't I think my thoughts?" You can answer this for yourself. If the voice in your head is you, who's the one listening to it...</p><h2>Revelations: Alien Contact and Human Deception</h2><p>"[A] bracing finale to Vallee's 'Alien Contact trilogy'...A forceful and refreshingly iconoclastic study."<br>THE KIRKUS REVIEWS<br><br>In REVELATIONS, Dr.Vallee, the inspiration for the character played by Francois Truffaut in Steven Spielberg's CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, analyzes the full gamut of sensational UFO "incidents" From the alleged history of saucer "crashes" and the retrieval of aliens by the U.S. government to reports of a subterranean community of hostile humanoids in the American Southwest, this is part scientific detective sotry, part experiement in truth seeking, REVELATIONS and is an astonishing document that is certain to provoke controversy.<br>The two earlier books in Dr. Vallee's Alien Contact trilogy are DIMENSIONS and CONFRONTATIONS.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>I first met Dr. Vallee while arranging the publicity tour for his previous book Confrontations. Even though I had seen "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" and knew that he was Spielberg's chief technical advisor on the film as well as the real-life model for the scientist played by Francois Truffant, I wasn't sure what to expect. After all, many people in the UFO community are, shall we say, extremely zealous. I was very impressed by his thoughtful manner and clearheaded analyses. Dr. Vallee is widely recognized and honored as the premier investigating scientist and UFO researcher. I also had the pleasure of arranging the publicity tour for Revelations, the concluding volume in Dr. Vallee's Alien Contact Trilogy. In this book, Dr. Vallee explores the various UFO hoaxes and media manipulation that have misled researchers. His painstaking investigation of industrial and governmental coverups leads to some astonishing and, at times, controversial conclusions. Vallee's thesis is that the fast-growing belief in alien contact is causing too many cases to be accepted as real that are not -- and conversely, too many actual ones go overlooked or misreported. Revelations comes in response to those oversights. It is both an experiment in truth-seeking and a scientific detective story.<br><br>M. Coolman<br>Ballantine PublicityBracing finale to Vallee's ``Alien Contact trilogy'' (Dimensions, 1988; Confrontations, 1990), as the ufologist brings some famous UFO cases down to earth--and into the mud. In Dimensions, Vallee presented his theory that UFOs are probably not spacecraft but manifestations of a consciousness- controlling ``technology'' from ``dimensions beyond spacetime''; in Confrontations, he bolstered that theory with examples from his own casebook. Here, deftly blending theory and memoir, he attempts to clear ufololgy of ``the weeds and the vines of human fantasy and...the poisonous flowers of unbalanced minds.'' That is, to Vallee, cases from the infamous Roswell incident (spacecraft and aliens purportedly captured by the US Army in 1947) to the popular legend of Area 51 (aliens working tentacle-in-hand with US officials beneath the Nevada desert) to the alleged abduction of Franck Fontaine in 1979 (exhaustively researched firsthand by Vallee) to the purported top-secret federal UFO-investigating committee of Howard Blum's Out There (1990) are not only mostly nonsense, but--here's the rub--``complex hoaxes that have been carefully engineered for our benefit.'' But by whom, and why? By federal disinformation agents, and possibly as ``psychological warfare experiments'' or ``as a cover for something else''--i.e., experimental spy/warcraft or real ``flying discs.'' Vallee offers little hard evidence to back those conjectures, but he does unglove the heavy hand of military intelligence in many cases, while at the same time exposing the absurdity of others, including Budd Hopkins's best-selling alien-rape reports. So what's left? A host of genuinely mysterious cases, e.g., the 1989 Soviet Union sightings, and the spirit of rigorous scientific inquiry that Vallee urges they be subjected to. Except for Vallee's wobbly conclusions, a forceful and refreshingly iconoclastic study that, for all its good sense, will likely add up to only a cry in the alien-infested ufowilderness. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Its running lights were muted, its navigational beacons quiet, its viewports for the most part as dark as the space around it.<br><br> Its drive gunning for all it was worth.<br><br> &#x201c;Hang on!&#x201d; Dubrak Qennto barked over the straining roar of the engines. &#x201c;Here he comes again!&#x201d;<br><br> Clenching his teeth firmly together to keep them from chattering, Jorj Car&#x2019;das got a grip on his seat&#x2019;s armrest with one hand as he finished punching coordinates into the nav computer with the other. Just in time; the Bargain Hunter jinked hard to the left as a pair of brilliant green blaster bolts burned past the bridge canopy. &#x201c;Car&#x2019;das?&#x201d; Qennto called. &#x201c;Snap it up, kid.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m snapping, I&#x2019;m snapping,&#x201d; Car&#x2019;das called back, resisting the urge to point out that the outmoded nav equipment was Qennto&#x2019;s property, not his. As was the lack of diplomacy and common sense that had gotten them into this mess in the first place. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t we just talk to them?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Terrific idea,&#x201d; Qennto bit out. &#x201c;Be sure to compliment Progga on his fairness and sound business sense.

Barely six standard months after signing on with Qennto and Maris, this was already the second time they&#x2019;d had to run for their lives from someone.<br><br> And this time it was a Hutt they&#x2019;d frizzled. Qennto, he thought darkly, had a genuine talent for picking his fights.<br><br> &#x201c;You okay, Jorj?&#x201d;<br><br> Car&#x2019;das looked up, blinking away a drop of sweat that had somehow found its way into his eye. Maris was swiveled around in her chair, looking back at him with concern. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; he said, wincing at the quavering in his voice.<br><br> &#x201c;Of course he is,&#x201d; Qennto assured Maris as he also turned around to look at their junior crewer. &#x201c;Those shots never even got close.&#x201d;<br><br> Car&#x2019;das braced himself. &#x201c;You know, Qennto, it may not be my place to say this&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t; and don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Qennto said gruffly, turning back to his board.<br><br> &#x201c;Progga the Hutt is not the sort of person you want mad at you,&#x201d; Car&#x2019;das said anyway. &#x201c;I mean, first there was that Rodian&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;A word about shipboard etiquette, kid,&#x201d; Qennto cut in, turning just far enough to send a single eye&#x2019;s worth of glower at Car&#x2019;das. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t argue with your captain. Not ever. Not unless you want this to be your first and last tour with us.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;d settle for it not being the last tour of my life,&#x201d; Car&#x2019;das muttered.<br><br> &#x201c;What was that?&#x201d;<br><br> Car&#x2019;das grimaced. &#x201c;Nothing.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let Progga worry you,&#x201d; Maris soothed. &#x201c;He has a rotten temper, but he&#x2019;ll cool off.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Before or after he racks the three of us and takes all the furs?&#x201d; Car&#x2019;das countered, eyeing the hyperdrive readings uneasily. That mauvine nullifier instability was definitely getting worse.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, Progga wouldn&#x2019;t have racked us,&#x201d; Qennto scoffed. &#x201c;He&#x2019;d have left that to Drixo when we had to tell her he&#x2019;d snatched her cargo. You do have that next jump ready, right?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Working on it,&#x201d; Car&#x2019;das said, checking the computer. &#x201c;But the hyperdrive&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Heads up,&#x201d; Qennto interrupted. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re coming out.&#x201d;<br><br> The starlines collapsed back into stars, and Car&#x2019;das keyed for a full sensor scan.<br><br> And jerked as a salvo of blaster shots sizzled past the canopy.<br><br> Qennto barked a short expletive. &#x201c;What the frizz?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He followed us,&#x201d; Maris said, sounding stunned.<br><br> &#x201c;And he&#x2019;s got the range,&#x201d; Qennto snarled as he threw the Bargain Hunter into another series of stomach-twisting evasive maneuvers. &#x201c;Car&#x2019;das, get us out of here!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Trying,&#x201d; Car&#x2019;das called back, fighting to read the computer displays as they bounced and wobbled in front of his eyes. There was no way it was going to calculate the next jump before even Qennto&#x2019;s luck ran out and the fuming Hutt back there finally connected.<br><br> But if Car&#x2019;das couldn&#x2019;t find a place for them to go, maybe he could find all the places for them not to go . . .<br><br> The sky directly ahead was full of stars, but there was plenty of empty black between them. Picking the biggest of the gaps, he punched the vector into the computer. &#x201c;Try this one,&#x201d; he called, keying it to Qennto.<br><br> &#x201c;What do you mean try?&#x201d; Maris asked.<br><br> The freighter rocked as a pair of shots caught it squarely on the aft deflector. &#x201c;Never mind,&#x201d; Qennto said before Car&#x2019;das could answer. He punched the board, and once again the starlines lanced out and faded into the blotchy hyperspace sky.<br><br> Maris exhaled in a huff. &#x201c;That was too close.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Okay, so maybe he is mad at us,&#x201d; Qennto conceded. &#x201c;Now. Like Maris said, kid, what do you mean, try this one?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t have time to calculate a proper jump,&#x201d; Car&#x2019;das explained. &#x201c;So I just aimed us into an empty spot with no stars.&#x201d;<br><br> Qennto swiveled around. &#x201c;You mean an empty spot with no visible stars?&#x201d; he asked ominously. &#x201c;An empty spot with no collapsed stars, or pre-star dark masses, or something hidden behind dust clouds? That kind of empty spot?&#x201d; He waved a hand toward the canopy. &#x201c;And out toward the Unknown Regions on top of it?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have enough data in that direction for him to have done a proper calculation anyway,&#x201d; Maris said, coming unex- pectedly to Car&#x2019;das&#x2019;s defense.<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not the point,&#x201d; Qennto insisted.<br><br> &#x201c;No, the point is that he got us away from Progga,&#x201d; Maris said. &#x201c;I think that deserves at least a thank-you.&#x201d;<br><br> Qennto rolled his eyes. &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Such thanks to be rescinded if and when we run through a star you didn&#x2019;t see, of course.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s more likely the hyperdrive will blow up first,&#x201d; Car&#x2019;das warned. &#x201c;Remember that nullifier problem I told you about? I think it&#x2019;s getting&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> He was cut off by a wailing sound from beneath them, and with a lurch the Bargain Hunter leapt forward like a giffa on a scent.<br><br> &#x201c;Running hot!&#x201d; Qennto shouted, spinning back to his board. &#x201c;Maris, shut &#x2019;er down!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Trying,&#x201d; Maris called back over the wailing as her fingers danced across her board. &#x201c;Control lines are looping&#x2014;can&#x2019;t get a signal through.&#x201d;<br><br> With a curse, Qennto popped his straps and heaved his bulk out of his seat. He sprinted down the narrow aisle, his elbow barely missing the back of Car&#x2019;das&#x2019;s head as he passed. Poking uselessly at his own controls, Car&#x2019;das popped his own strap release and started to follow.<br><br> &#x201c;Car&#x2019;das, get up here,&#x201d; Maris called, gesturing him forward.<br><br> &#x201c;He might need me,&#x201d; Car&#x2019;das said as he nevertheless reversed direction and headed forward.<br><br> &#x201c;Sit,&#x201d; she ordered, nodding sideways at Qennto&#x2019;s vacated pilot&#x2019;s seat. &#x201c;Help me watch the tracker&#x2014;if we veer off this vector before Rak figures out how to pull the plug, I need to know about it.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But Qennto&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Word of advice, friend,&#x201d; she interrupted, her eyes still on her displays. &#x201c;This is Rak&#x2019;s ship. If there are any tricky repairs to be made, he&#x2019;s the one who&#x2019;ll make them.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Even if I happen to know more about a particular system than he does?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Especially if you happen to know more about it than he does,&#x201d; she said drily. &#x201c;But in this case, you don&#x2019;t. Trust me.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; Car&#x2019;das said with a sigh. &#x201c;Such trust to be rescinded if and when we blow up, of course.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re learning,&#x201d; she said approvingly. &#x201c;Now run a systems check on the scanners and see if the instability&#x2019;s bled over into them. Then do the same for the nav computer. Once we get through this, I want to make sure we can find our way home again.&#x201d;</p><h2>Harvey Pekar&#39;s Cleveland</h2><p>A lifelong Cleveland resident, Harvey Pekar (1939-2010) pioneered autobiographical comics, mining the mundane for magic since 1976 in his ongoing American Splendor series.

Lynda Barry, creator of the 'My Life' and 'Ernie Pook's Comeek' comic strips, is syndicated in over 40 alternative weekly newspapers across the country. The Freddie Stories&#x2014;featuring sisters Marlys and Maybonne, and their spunky little brother Freddie--continues Lynda Barry's brilliant, raw, and completely original exploration of youth, coming of age, friendship, attitude, and being in the world.</p><p><i>The Freddie Stories</i> is a collection of strips from Lynda Barry's weekly cartoon, <i>Ernie Pook's Comeek</i>. As the title suggests, all the strips feature Freddie, a gentle misfit and self-described "fag" who goes through a wrenching year. Though Barry's drawing style is whimsical and her protagonists are kids, this is definitely not a book for young children. The haunting--and sometimes downright disturbing--stories cover everything from the fluid nature of friendships to special ed. class to arson. Not only do Freddie's peers misunderstand him, his mother is cold and distant and makes no secret of the fact that she dislikes him. Tough odds, but luckily Freddie has his exuberant sister, Marlys, to help him through. Though the bright spots in <i>The Freddie Stories</i> are few and far between, it's a nearly impossible book to put down once you've started it. Barry's young characters are as painfully real as her drawings are hypnotic. <i>--Ali Davis</i><b>Lynda Barry</b> was born in Wisconsin in 1956, and later studied at Evergreen State College.

Charles made a derisive noise. &#x2018;All it needs,' she said, eyeing him, &#x2018;is a little levelling.'</p> <p>&#x2018;All it needs,' said Charles rudely, &#x2018;is a hay-cutter and a steam-roller. And this is the place you wouldn't sell!'</p> <p>His sister-in-law took up the cudgels. &#x2018;It's perfectly lovely, and you know it. As soon as Celia and I set eyes on it we fell for it.'</p> <p>&#x2018;That I can believe,' said Charles. &#x2018;A mullioned window or two, and a ruined chapel, and I'd expect you two to go over at the knees. But Peter was with you. What did he fall for? Beer at the local pub?'</p> <p>&#x2018;There's a trout-stream at the bottom of the garden,' Margaret pointed out.</p> <p>&#x2018;So there is,' Charles agreed. &#x2018;And another in the servants' hall for wet days. Bowers showed it to me.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Simply because there was a pane of glass out of one of the windows!' Celia said hotly. &#x2018;Of course the rain came in!'</p> <p>Margaret tucked her hand in Charles' arm. &#x2018;Wait till you've seen your bedroom. It's got linen-fold panelling, and there's a cupboard which is all part of it, and which takes you ages to find.'</p> <p>&#x2018;That really is jolly,' Charles said. &#x2018;Then if anyone burgles our room he won't be able to find my dress-coat. I suppose I can mark the place with a cross.'</p> <p>&#x2018;No, you have a compass, and take bearings,' retorted his wife. &#x2018;Come on in, and we'll show you.'</p> <p>They turned away from the tennis-court and began to walk back towards the house down one of the neglected paths that wound between flower-beds to the terrace on the south side of the building.</p> <p>&#x2018;Chas, can you look at it with the sun on that heavenly grey stone, and blame us for refusing to part with it?' Margaret exclaimed.</p> <p>&#x2018;I'll wait till I've seen my room,' Charles replied.</p> <p>But he had to admit that this house, which had been left to his wife and her brother and sister, was artistically all that could be desired. Built originally many hundreds of years before of grey stone, much of it was now ruined, and much had been added at different periods, so that the present house was a rambling structure, set in wooded grounds where oaks, which had been there when the Conqueror landed, reared up huge gnarled trunks from out of a tangle of undergrowth. A drive of about a quarter of a mile in length twisted through the trees to the gates that opened on to the road which led to the village of Framley, a mile away if you went by road, but much less if you walked across the fields at the back of the house.</p> <p>Down the road towards the village, but set back inside the Priory grounds, were the ruins of the chapel which had so captivated Celia's fancy. Dismantled during the Reformation, and later battered by Cromwell's cannon, not much of it now remained, but fragments of the walls rose up crumbling out of the grass. Here and there part of the walls remained to show the Gothic windows, but for the most part they were no more than a few feet in height.</p> <p>The Priory itself had been restored so that the many rebuildings and additions had left little outward appearance of the old home of the monks. Celia, who had acquired a book on Old Abbeys, declared that the library, a big room giving on to the terrace, was the original refectory, but she admitted that the panelling was probably of later date.</p> <p>The place had come to her quite unexpectedly. An uncle whom she, in company with Peter and Margaret, had visited at dutiful intervals during his lifetime, had bequeathed the Priory to his nephew and his two nieces. No lover of rural solitudes, he himself had never occupied the house. In his turn he had inherited it some five years before from his sister, who had lived there through marriage and widowhood. As she left it so it now stood, and no sooner had Celia Malcolm, and Peter and Margaret Fortescue seen it, than they declared it was just the place they had dreamed of for years. At least, the two sisters said so. Peter was less enthusiastic, but agreed it would be a pity to sell it.</p> <p>It had been to let for quite a long time, but ever since the first tenants who rented the house two years after the death of its original owner, had left, no one had made even the smallest offer for it.</p> <p>&#x2018;Your uncle had a good deal of trouble over the house,' had said Mr Milbank, the solicitor. &#x2018;When she lived in it his sister never made any complaint, but she was an eccentric old lady, and it's conceivable she wouldn't have cared. But the fact of the matter is, Mrs Malcolm, the house has got rather a bad name. The people your uncle let it to took it for three years and they left at the end of one. They said the place was haunted.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Oo!' said Margaret. &#x2018;What a thrill for us!'</p> <p>The lawyer smiled. &#x2018;I shouldn't build on it, Miss Fortescue. I think you'll find that it's nothing more thrilling than rats. But I thought I'd warn you. So that if you feel you'd rather not take possession of a reputedly haunted house you might like me to follow up this offer.' He lifted up a sheet of note-paper that lay on his desk, and looked inquiringly at Peter.</p> <p>&#x2018;Is that the offer you wrote to us about?' Peter asked. &#x2018;Some fellow who saw the board up when he was motoring in that part of the world, and wanted to know particulars?'</p> <p>Mr Milbank nodded. Celia and Margaret turned anxiously to their brother, and began to urge the desirability of owning a country house so near to town, and yet so ideal in situation and character.</p> <p>The trout stream won Peter over. Charles, a young barrister with a growing practice, had no time to waste, so he said, in going to look at a house which his wife was apparently set on inhabiting whether he liked it or not. He placed his trust in Peter.</p> <p>&#x2018;And nicely you've abused it,' he said, over tea in the library. &#x2018;For two months you three have dashed to and fro, doing what you called "getting it ready to live in." Incidentally you lulled my suspicions with lying stories about the house, till I almost believed it was something like your description. You' he pointed an accusing finger at Margaret &#x2018;said it was the ideal home. The fact that there was only one bathroom and a system of heating water that won't do more than one hot bath at a time, you carefully concealed.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Do you good to have a few cold baths,' remarked Peter, spreading jam on a slice of bread and butter. &#x2018;It isn't as though we propose to live here through the winter. Moreover, I don't see why we shouldn't convert one of the bedrooms into a second bathroom, and put in a better heating arrangement. Not immediately, of course, but at some future date.'</p> <p>Charles eyed him coldly. &#x2018;And what about light? Oh, and a telephone! I suppose we can wire the house while we're about it. This must be what Celia called "getting a country-house for nothing." I might have known.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Personally,' said Celia, &#x2018;I prefer lamps and candles. Electric light would be out of place in a house like this, and as for a telephone, that's the one thing I've been wanting to escape from.' She nodded briskly at her husband. &#x2018;You're going to have a real holiday this year, my man, quite cut off from town.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Thanks very much,' said Charles. &#x2018;And what was it you said just before tea? Something about going to the village to order bacon for breakfast?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, you can take the car,' Celia pointed out. &#x2018;And you might try and get hold of a gardener in the village. I think the garden is rather more than you and Peter can manage.'</p> <p>&#x2018;It is,' said Charles, with conviction. &#x2018;Much more.'</p> <p>The door opened at that moment to admit a middle-aged lady of comfortable proportions, and placid demeanour. This was Mrs Bosanquet, the Fortescues' aunt. She accepted a chair, and some tea, condemned a solid-looking cake, and embarked on bread and butter.</p> <p>&#x2018;I have unpacked my boxes,' she announced, &#x2018;but I twice lost the wardrobe.'</p> <p>&#x2018;What, have you got one of those little practical jokes?' Charles demanded.</p> <p>Mrs Bosanquet turned an amiable and inquiring countenance towards him. She was deaf. When Charles had repeated his question, she nodded. &#x2018;Yes, dear, but I have stuck a piece of stamp-paper on the catch. A very quaint old house. I was talking to Mrs Bowers, and she tells me you could lose yourself in the cellars.'</p> <p>&#x2018;That's nothing,' said Charles, getting up. &#x2018;I lost myself getting from our room to my dressing-room. Of course it would simplify matters if we locked a few of the empty rooms, but I agree it would take away from the sporting element. Are you coming to the village, Peter?'</p> <p>&#x2018;I am,' Peter replied. &#x2018;I will introduce you to some very fine draught beer there.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Lead on!' Charles said, brightening.</p> <p>The lane that led to Framley was wooded, and picturesque enough to draw a grudging word of approval from Charles. Peter, negotiating a hairpin bend, said: &#x2018;Seriously, Chas, the place has possibilities.'</p> <p>&#x2018;I don't deny it. But what's all this bilge about noises and hauntings, and footsteps in the dark?'</p> <p>&#x2018;God knows. In the village they all but cross themselves if you mention the Priory. I daresay there are rats. Milbank said...'</p> <p>&#x2018;Look here, do you mean to say you knew about this haunting before you came down here? And not one word to me?'</p> <p>Peter said in some surprise: &#x2018;I didn't think anything of it. You aren't going to tell me you'd have refused to live in the place if you'd known?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Aren't I?' said Charles grimly. &#x2018;If you'd left as many desirable residences and hotels at a moment's notice as I have, all because Celia "felt something queer" about them, you'd never have come near the place.'</p> <p>&#x2018;She says she doesn't believe there's anything wrong with the house. All village superstition.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Does she? Well, I'll lay you six to one in sovereigns that the first rat heard scuttling overhead will spell our departure. Especially with Bowers shivering round the house.'</p> <p>&#x2018;What's the matter with him? Been listening to village gossip?'</p> <p>&#x2018;That, and natural palsy of spirit. He unpacked my things and gave a life-like imitation of the mysterious butler of fiction while he did so. "All I know is, sir, I wouldn't go down those cellar stairs after dark, not if I were paid to." Oh yes, and I need hardly say that the first night he and Mrs Bowers spent alone in the house before you came down, he heard footsteps outside his door, and a hand feeling over the panels.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Silly ass!' Peter said. &#x2018;You can console yourself with the thought that it would take more than a ghost to upset the redoubtable Mrs Bowers. Allow me to tell you that we are now approaching the Bell Inn. Genuine fourteenth century in parts.'</p> <p>The car had emerged from the tree-shadowed lane into the outskirts of the village, which stretched aimlessly along one narrow main street. The Bell Inn, a picturesque and rambling old hostelry built round a courtyard, was one of the first buildings on the street. Peter Fortescue ran the car up to the door and switched off the engine. &#x2018;Opening time,' he grinned. &#x2018;Take heart, Chas, I can vouch for the beer.'</p> <p>They entered into a long, low-pitched taproom, with a beamed ceiling, and little latticed windows that gave on to the street. Oak settles formed various secluded nooks in the room, and behind the bar stood a landlord of such comfortable proportions and such benevolent mien that he might well have stepped from the pages of Dickens.</p> <p>Leaning against the bar, and apparently engaging Mr Wilkes in desultory conversation, was his very antithesis, a thin, wiry little man, with a very sharp face and pale eyes that darted from object to object with a quickness that gave a disagreeable impression of shiftiness. He glanced at Peter as Peter crossed the threshold, and at once looked away again.</p> <p>&#x2018;Evening, Wilkes,' Peter said. &#x2018;I've brought my brother-in-law along to try that draught bitter of yours.'</p> <p>Mr Wilkes beamed upon them both. &#x2018;Very glad to see any friend of yours here, sir. Two half-cans, sir? You shall have it.' He took down a couple of pewter tankards from a shelf behind him, and drew two half-pints of frothing beer. Having supplied his patrons with this, he wiped down the bar with a mechanical action, and said affably: &#x2018;And how are you getting on up at the Priory, sir, if I may ask?'</p> <p>&#x2018;All right, thanks. We haven't seen your ghost yet. When does he usually show up?'</p> <p>The smile faded. Mr Wilkes looked at Peter rather queerly, and said in an altered voice: &#x2018;I wouldn't joke about it, sir, not if I was you.'</p> <p>Charles emerged from his tankard. &#x2018;Has my man Bowers been in here at all?' he demanded.</p> <p>The landlord looked surprised; the small stranger, who had edged away a little when the newcomers first entered, shot a quick look at Charles.</p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, sir, several times,' Wilkes answered.</p> <p>&#x2018;I thought so,' said Charles. &#x2018;And did you tell him that the ghost prowled round the passages, and pawed all the doors?'</p> <p>Wilkes seemed to draw back. &#x2018;Has he heard it again?' he asked.</p> <p>&#x2018;Heard my eye!' Charles retorted. &#x2018;All he heard was what you told him, and his own imagination.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Joking apart, Wilkes, you don't really believe in the thing, do you?' Peter asked.</p> <p>The small man, who had looked for a moment as though he were going to say something, moved unobtrusively away to a seat by one of the windows, and fishing a crumpled newspaper from his pocket began to read it.</p> <p>For a moment Wilkes did not reply; then he said quite simply: &#x2018;I've seen it, sir.' Peter's brows lifted incredulously, and Wilkes added: &#x2018;And what's more, I've seen as reasonable a man as what you are yourself pack up and leave that place with two years of his lease still to run. A little over five years it is since I took over this house, and when I first come here the Priory was standing as empty as when you first saw it. I suppose old Mrs Matthews, that used to own it, had been dead a matter of a year or fifteen months. From all accounts she was a queer one. Well, there was the Priory, going to ruin, as you might say, and never a soul would go near the place after dark, not if they was paid to. Now, I daresay you'll agree I don't look one of the fanciful ones myself, sir, and nor I'm not, and the first thing I did when I heard what folk said of the place, was to make a joke of it, like what you're doing now. Then Ben Tillman, that keeps the mill up to Crawshays, he laid me I wouldn't go up to the old ruin after dark one night.' He paused, and again wiped down the bar with that odd air of abstraction. He drew a long breath, as though some horror still lingered in his memory. &#x2018;Well, I went, sir. Nor I wasn't afraid not then. It was a moonlit night, and besides that I had my torch if I'd needed it. But I didn't. I sat down on one of those old tombs you'll find in the chapel, half covered by grass and weeds. I didn't think anything out of the ordinary for some while. If I remember rightly, I whistled a bit, by way of passing the time. I couldn't say how long it was before I noticed the change. I think it must have come gradual.'</p> <p>&#x2018;What change?' asked Charles, unimpressed.</p> <p>Again the landlord paused. &#x2018;It's very hard to tell you, sir. It wasn't anything you could take hold of, as you might say. Things looked the same, and there wasn't more than a breath of wind, yet it got much colder all at once. And it was as fine a June night as you could hope for. I don't know how I can explain it so as you'd understand, but it was as though the cold was spreading right over me, and into me. And instead of whistling tunes to myself, and thinking how I'd have the laugh over Ben Tillman, I found I was sitting still still as death. It had sort of crept on me wi...</p></p><h2>Faithfull: An Autobiography</h2><p>A rock legend recounts the tale of her career, from her first hit with &#34;As Tears Go By,&#34; through her affair with Mick Jagger, her descent into drug dependency, and her personal and professional resurgence. 50,000 first printing. Tour.</p><p>Peggy Lipton has most recently appeared onstage in "The Guys" and "The Vagina Monologues" and on television in "Alias" and the WB's "Popular," She lives in New York and Los Angeles. This is her first book. <br>David Dalton has written a number of books, including "Piece of My Heart: A Portrait of Janis Joplin" and "Faithfull: An Autobiography," Coco Pekelis Dalton is the author of "Everything I Know I Learned on Acid." The Daltons live in upstate New York.<br>A searing autobiography by one of rock 'n' roll's most tragic and romantic figures. A descendant of Austrian novelist Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, the beautiful Faithfull was discovered by Rolling Stones manager Andrew Oldham in 1964 and became an instant pop celebrity with her recording of the brooding ``As Tears Go By,'' a song Oldham asked Mick Jagger and Keith Richards to write for her. In a short time, Faithfull had become an internationally famous music and movie star, but she had little control over her image or artistic output. With the aid of rock biographer Dalton (Mr. Mojo Risin': Jim Morrison, the Last Holy Fool, 1991, etc.), she describes her struggle against the passive ``Angel Doll'' persona foisted on her by the press and her relationship to the Stones, especially Jagger, for whom she left husband John Dunbar in 1966. A dark romanticism- -what she calls a ``Walter Pater aestheticism,'' replete with flashes of everything from astrology to black magic--pervades the narrative, which is chock-full of encounters with pop legends (John Lennon is ``amusingly cruel''; Allen Ginsberg ``has never been hip''). Faithfull, who's had her own share of same-sex dalliances, suggests it was sexual tensions among the highly repressed Stones that gave them their manic energy: ``Who was the great love of [Jagger's] life? Actually, I think it was Keith.'' The tone is both compelling and pathetic as Faithfull details two decades of drug abuse and numerous lonely attempts to escape her addiction. From watching a lover commit suicide to recent singing and acting successes on her own terms, Faithfull has lived enough for three or four people--yet she is only 47. Despite some trite prose (``Things were happening so fast and we were changing with them''), this holds greater interest than any other recent book about the Stones and their circle.

After reading the first few pages, I knew I had something in my hand that was extraordinary. Day by day during my devotional time I read at least one section and found the book to contain one of the most practical approaches to the various areas of my spiritual life that I have ever read. I asked others to read it, and they confirmed my impressions. The various parts of the book were originally prepared as short letters and were sent to a number of interested friends. They were then compiled into the book which was known as The Green Letters, but in order to make this new printing meaningful to a new audience, the title has been changed to Principles of Spiritual Growth. We are thankful for permission from the author to publish this book for the benefit of a larger group of friends.

The state of Israel is five days old. The city of Jerusalem is tenuously poised for a clash that will be critical in the life of the new country. Holding the keys to an Israeli victory is a diverse, rag-tag group: Peter Wallich, once a teacher of agriculture in the kibbutz, now instructing teens in the assembly of Molotov cocktails; the 74-year-old mother superior, who desperately wants to preserve her convent from annihilation; Commander Moshe Sachar and his wife Rachel, who cling together amidst the horrors of war; and an Arab street urchin, Daoud, who repays the kindness of the so-called infidels in the best way he knows how. Interspersed throughout is the appearance of a mysterious old gardener, with wounds on the palms of both hands.<p> In the Zion Legacy series, the Thoenes return to a cast of characters and themes from their bestselling Zion Chronicles series that earned them a sterling reputation and a faithful readership in the Christian fiction arena. This second installment, <i>Thunder from Jerusalem</i>, starts slowly as the characters are reintroduced, and the stage is set. Then, the pace accelerates. The lives of Muslims, Jews, and Catholics all intersect in a tale of romance and suffering, patriotism and betrayal.

Now celebrating its 40th anniversary, NPR&#39;s programming attracts over 27 million listeners every week. This beautifully designed volume chronicles NPR&#39;s storied history, featuring dozens of behind-the-scenes photos, essays and original reporting by a who&#39;s who of NPR staff and correspondents, transcripts of memorable interviews, and an audio CD of the most memorable programming throughout the decades. Beyond an entertaining and inspiring tribute to NPR&#39;s remarkable history, this book is an intimate look at the news and stories that have shaped our world, from the people who were on the ground and on the air. With contributions from Steve Inskeep, Neal Conan, Robert Siegel, Nina Totenberg, Linda Wertheimer, Scott Simon, Melissa Block, P.J. O&#39;Rourke, David Sedaris, Sylvia Poggioli, Paula Poundstone, and many more, this is the perfect book for any NPR supporter, fan, or devotee.</p><p>Since it&#39;s first broadcast in 1970, NPR and its contributors have been honored with over 600 awards in broadcasting, including the Edward R. Murray Award, the Peabody Award, and much more. The mission of NPR is to work in partnership with member stations to create a more informed public - one challenged and invigorated by a deeper understanding and appreciation of events, ideas and cultures. To accomplish our mission, we produce, acquire, and distribute programming that meets the highest standards of public service in journalism and cultural expression; we represent our members in matters of their mutual interest; and we provide satellite interconnection for the entire public radio system. The main text of the chapters in the book are authored by the following NPR hosts: Foreword by Cokie Roberts Introduction by Susan Stamberg The 1970s by Noah Adams The 1980s by John Ydstie The 1990s by Renee Montagne The 2000s by Ari Shapiro Epilogue: The Future of NPR by David FolkenflikThis celebration of National Public Radio comes in a snappy magazine style, full of short histories from familiar names. NPR's shaky start was fortified by the devotion of the few staffers working out of a small office in D.C. The Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 only included radio because of a push from broadcast veterans at the University of Michigan, but the CPB set aside a paltry 10% of funds for Public Radio. Stories such as these remind us that NPR existed, and exists, as a way for everyday voices to explain the world, rather than the stentorian tones of broadcast news. Sylvia Poggioli, Nina Totenberg, Renee Montagne, Cokie Roberts (who suggested that NPR attracted so many talented women because salaries were too low for men), and others were on the front lines of war coverage, reporting from Rwanda to Bosnia to Afghanistan; as a former NPR senior foreign editor put it, "You really never saw a reporting team made up mostly of women." It's fitting that the women, and the men, who built NPR should be the ones to present this retrospective illustrating just how much they have given us. <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Its 2,140 miles run through 14 states--from Georgia to Maine--and vastly different natural and social environments, from the solitary splendor of mountain crags to the genial slopes frequented by dayhikers and scout packs. Each year, more than three million visitors enjoy the diverse scenery and cultures of the trail, united by a common appreciation for the outdoors. A lively and evocative introduction to this national treasure, <em>The Appalachian Trail Reader</em> collects stories, poems, and essays that reflect this wilderness trail across both time and geography.<br> Here are the works of both well-known writers and anonymous raconteurs, including Henry David Thoreau, James Dickey, Aldo Leopold, Washington Irving, James MacGregor Burns, Richard Wilbur, and many others, as well as excerpts from the diaries and letters of modern day visitors. Hikers' private journals stand next to scientists' close observations of the natural world, and these readings mingle with poets' evocations of meaningful music heard in the wind, in birdsong, or in the babbling brooks. Here, too, are historians, who remind us of how Appalachian culture developed, and early explorers, reporting the thrill of seeing uncharted territory and wildlife for the first time. Taken as a whole, this patchwork quilt of voices both eloquent and raw offers a surprisingly varied pattern of appreciation for the wilds of the Appalachians. With the addition of maps of the trail and photographs of its majesty, <em>The Appalachian Trail Reader</em> presents a rich introduction to the trail for those planning a trip, and a vivid scrapbook for those who've already visited.<br> Originally conceived as an antidote to the competitive, fast-paced, and increasingly urban civilization that America was becoming, the Appalachian Trail is more than an experience of geology and natural history; indeed, it is a vast open-air cathedral where the emotions and the senses unite. <em>The</em> <em>Appalachian Trail Reader</em> bears out this spirit, offering a heart-felt appreciation of one of our greatest natural resources while it presents an opportunity to escape the stresses of everyday life and revel in the inestimable value of a wilderness experience.</p><p>The Appalachian Trail, at 2,150 miles, is the longest continuous recreational footpath in America. From a variety of sources, Emblidge culled random trail gems to create an Appalachian quilt of an anthology. Through the Green Mountains, the Adirondacks, and the Great Smokies, the trail links the ridges and valleys, as well as a diverse cross-section of American cultures. With practical trail details and an eclectic assembly of hiking wisdom, you can read it straight through, or a chapter at a time, as you plan your next hike. It&#39;s just a shame it&#39;s too heavy to pack along.<br><em>About the Editor:</em><br><strong>David Emblidge</strong> is the editor of <em>The Third Berkshire Anthology: A Collection of Literature and Art</em>.

Today, The Diary of a Young Girl has sold over 25 million copies world-wide.It is one of the most celebrated and enduring books of the last century and it remains a deeply admired testament to the indestructible nature of human spirit.Anne Frank and her family fled the horrors of Nazi occupation by hiding in the back of a warehouse in Amsterdam for two years with another family and a German dentist. Aged thirteen when she went into the secret annexe, Anne kept a diary. She movingly revealed how the eight people living under these extraordinary conditions coped with hunger, the daily threat of discovery and death and being cut off from the outside world, as well as petty misunderstandings and the unbearable strain of living like prisoners.The Diary of a Yong Girl is a timeless true story to be rediscovered by each new generation. For young readers and adults it continues to bring to life Anne&#39;s extraordinary courage and struggle throughout her ordeal.&#39;One of the greatest books of the century&#39; Guardian&#39;A modern classic&#39; The Times&#39;Rings down the decades as the most moving testament to the persecution of innocence&#39; Daily Mail&#39;Astonishing and excruciating. Its gnaws at us still&#39; New York Times Book ReviewAnne Frank was born on 12 June 1929. She died in Bergen-Belsen, three months short of her sixteenth birthday.</p><p>A beloved classic since its initial publication in 1947, this vivid, insightful journal is a fitting memorial to the gifted Jewish teenager who died at Bergen-Belsen, Germany, in 1945. Born in 1929, Anne Frank received a blank diary on her 13th birthday, just weeks before she and her family went into hiding in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam. Her marvelously detailed, engagingly personal entries chronicle 25 trying months of claustrophobic, quarrelsome intimacy with her parents, sister, a second family, and a middle-aged dentist who has little tolerance for Anne's vivacity. The diary's universal appeal stems from its riveting blend of the grubby particulars of life during wartime (scant, bad food; shabby, outgrown clothes that can't be replaced; constant fear of discovery) and candid discussion of emotions familiar to every adolescent (everyone criticizes me, no one sees my real nature, when will I be loved?). Yet Frank was no ordinary teen: the later entries reveal a sense of compassion and a spiritual depth remarkable in a girl barely 15. Her death epitomizes the madness of the Holocaust, but for the millions who meet Anne through her diary, it is also a very individual loss. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>The diary as Anne Frank wrote it. At last, in a new translation, this definitive edition contains entries about Anne's burgeoning sexuality and confrontations with her mother that were cut from previous editions. Anne Frank's <i>The Diary Of A Young Girl</i> is among the most enduring documents of the twentieth century. Since its publication in 1947, it has been a beloved and deeply admired monument to the indestructible nature of the human spirit, read by millions of people and translated into more than fifty-five languages. Doubleday, which published the first English translation of the diary in 1952, now offers a new translation that captures Anne's youthful spirit and restores the original material omitted by Anne's father, Otto -- approximately thirty percent of the diary. The elder Frank excised details about Anne's emerging sexuality, and about the often-stormy relations between Anne and her mother. Anne Frank and her family, fleeing the horrors of Nazi occupation forces, hid in the back of an Amsterdam office building for two years. This is Anne's record of that time. She was thirteen when the family went into the "Secret Annex," and in these pages, she grows to be a young woman and proves to be an insightful observer of human nature as well. A timeless story discovered by each new generation, <i>The Diary Of A Young Girl</i> stands without peer. For young readers and adults, it continues to bring to life this young woman, who for a time survived the worst horrors the modern world had seen -- and who remained triumphantly and heartbreakingly human throughout her ordeal.</p><h2>A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian</h2><p>A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian is bestselling author Marina Lewycka&#39;s hilarious and award winning debut novel.&#39;Two years after my mother died, my father fell in love with a glamorous blonde Ukrainian divorcee.

The best-selling author shares her inspiration for each of the quilts featured in The Winding Ways Quilt, The Quilter&#39;s Kitchen, The Lost Quilter, A Quilter&#39;s Holiday, The Aloha Quilt, The Union Quilters, and The Wedding Quilt. Create a bit of Elm Creek for your home!</p><p>Jennifer Chiaverini is the author of the &#34;New York Times&#34; bestselling Elm Creek Quilts series, five collections of quilt projects, and &#34;Mrs. Lincoln s Dressmaker&#34;, her most recent historical novel. A graduate of the University of Notre Dame and the University of Chicago, she lives with her husband and sons in Madison, Wisconsin." Chiaverini (The Wedding Quilt) writes novels plotted around the Elm Creek Quilters. She describes well the work produced by the women, but all the fine adjectives in the fiction do not do justice to the quilts she produces. Perhaps that's why, in addition to 18 novels, Chiaverini has also authored four collections of quilt projects, based on the novels' quilts. Her newest contains quilts described in Chiaverini's last half-dozen novels, along with sidebar quotes from the novels, but discusses little of the quilts themselves. For The Last Quilter, set in the Civil War, Chiaverini designed Mr. Lincoln's Spy. Pineapple Patch, the quilt developed from The Aloha Quilt, is worked in an emerald green material set in ivory from Chiaverini's fabric line. She designed the 13 projects, including two holiday quilts, and pieced them, sometimes aided by her mother, Geraldine Neidenbach, and her sister, Heather Neidenbach; a friend, Sue Vollbrecht, machine-quilted them. Templates are sized to work with. The directions, from cutting to constructing, instruct the intermediate quilter; for example, terms like "cornerstones" are not defined and the quilter is occasionally referred to a general quiltmaking book for technique advice.

The present Lord Spencer, the 9th Earl, traces the history of the house and writes about the changes that he has made since he inherited it and since the death of his sister, Diana, Princess of Wales.</p><p>This account of Althorp, his family seat, by Charles, the ninth earl Spencer, only scratches the surface of its 500-year history. Nevertheless, whether he is describing the sleepless nights of his childhood, the ticking of clocks "always ... too subtle a sound, getting absorbed in the oak of the floorboards and the fabric of the tapestries," or appraising the forbidding character of his grandfather, the "Curator Earl," Spencer casts a candid, evocative light on his subject.<p> Indeed, Spencer's own efforts on the estate have been considerable. First comes the business of repairing the predations of his "short-termist stepmother," Raine, the countess of Dartmouth, who has laid down wall-to-wall oatmeal carpet in a 115-foot-long Tudor picture gallery. Now comes the death and burial on the estate of his sister, Diana, the princess of Wales. That Charles must now curate the family home as a site of global mourning is a trial quite the equal of anything the estate has ever faced.</p><p> Subtitled "The Story of an English House," the book has a structure, dividing the subject into buildings, grounds, family history, and collections, that is entirely conventional. Yet Spencer surprises by packing in many details about the social and political vicissitudes that shaped his family's wealth and taste. In doing so, he eschews his grandfather's regrettable elitism, while losing none of the old man's dedication to the family's heritage. Like all good introductions, this book suggests a world and time far exceeding its little compass. <i>--Simon Ings</i></p>Charles, Viscount Althorp, became the ninth Earl Spencer on the death of his father in 1992. Since then he has undertaken extensive refurbishment of Althorp and supervised the changes made to accommodate the many thousands of people who wish to visit the home and grounds since the death of his sister. He was educated at Eton College and obtained his degree in Modern History at Magdalen College, Oxford.</p><h2>World Killers (Sentinels)</h2><p>The bearlike Karbarrans and the swashbuckling amazons from Praxis, the feral natives of Garuda and the Human Robotech heroes -- these oddly -- met champions banded together with other races, from other planets, to form the Sentinels.<br><br>Yet what fighting force could hope to dislodge the Invid hordes from Haydon IV, ethereal world of superscience and hidden emotional conflict; or Spheris, crystalline globe of living minerals and murderous resonances?<br><br>The Sentinels launch their attack nevertheless; they've come too far to surrender to tyranny. But the treachery of a megalomanic Human general and a mutating Invid P.O.W. make the war seem hopeless.<br><br>The Sentinels battle on, though, because for them it's...<br><br>Victory or Death!</p><p></p><h2>Toxic Sludge is Good For You: Lies, Damn Lies and the Public Relations Industry</h2><p><p>Common Courage&#x2019;s number one seller blows the lid off of today's multi-billion-dollar propaganda-for-hire PR industry, revealing how public relations wizards concoct and spin the news, organize phony "grassroots" front groups, spy on citizens and conspire with lobbyists and politicians.</p></p><p>Sure, many of us in this modern world are cynical. The most cynical may even suspect that the news is manipulated and massaged by sponsors, that corporations act in their best interests, that political campaigns are determined not by votes, but by bucks, and that we don&#39;t get &#34;all the news that&#39;s fit to print&#34; but instead, &#34;all the news that gets the ink&#34;.

In his unique approach to mental training, Arno Ilgner draws essential elements from the rich &#39;warrior&#39; literature, as well as from sports psychology, and combines these with his extensive climbing experience to create The Rock Warrior`s Way. Here is a comprehensive program for learning how to focus your mental resources during a challenging climb. It includes step-by-step guidance on motivation analysis, information gathering, risk assessment, mental focus, and deliberate transition into action. Poor use of attention creates fear, which can manifest itself as anything from performance anxiety to sheer terror. By using attention more purposefully we can understand how fear is created, deal with it effectively, and free ourselves to get back in touch with a far more powerful motivating force--our love of climbing. We can then create the kind of unbending intention that leads to outstanding performance. The Rock Warrior`s Way is a revolutionary program for climbers who want to improve both their performance and their enjoyment of climbing.</p><p>Arno Ilgner distinguished himself as a pioneering rock climber in the 1970s and 80s, when the top climbs were bold and dangerous first ascents. These personal exploits are the foundation for Ilgner s unique physical and mental training program--The Warrior`s Way. In 1995, after a thorough search of the literature and practice of mental training and the great warrior traditions, Ilgner formalized his methods, founded the Desiderata Institute, and began teaching his program full time. Since then, he has helped hundreds of student sharpen their awareness, focus attention, and understand their athletic (and life) challenges within a coherent, learning-based philosophy of intelligent risk-taking. Ilgner considers the joy and satisfaction in the effort the journey intimately linked to successful attainment of goals, the destination. Alumni of his courses now include some of the nation s most prominent climbers. Ilgner has run clinics in the north- and southeastern U.S, to California, Canada, and the U.K. He has worked with young competition climbers and written national magazine articles based on his methods. He holds a BA in geology, spent several years operating his own geological consulting firm in the Wyoming oil fields, acted as Chief Financial Officer for an industrial tool distribution company, attended the Army Ranger School, and served a non-combat tour of duty in Korea. He currently resides with his family near Nashville, Tennessee.</p><h2>Middle School, The Worst Years of My Life (Middle School, 1)</h2><p><b>NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE!</b><br><b>In his acclaimed and #1 bestselling middle-grade comic debut, Children's Choice Award Author of the Year James Patterson has never been more hilarious--or heartwarming. </b><br>Rafe Khatchadorian has enough problems at home without throwing his first year of middle school into the mix.

What if the things we do to try to increase our happiness are actually making us feel worse? As incredible as it may sound, much of sadness and frustration we feel is actually created by our well-meaning efforts to find happiness. Relief from this predicament can be found through a divine gospel paradox that rescues us from failed roads and puts us on the surprising path to happiness. Through engaging stories and fresh, invigorating gospel insights, James Ferrell has written a book that challenges our unquestioned and perhaps mistaken assumptions about many of life s fundamental concerns. For example, what if happiness depends less on forgiving ourselves than on giving up that quest? What if repentance is even sweeter than forgiveness? What if happiness isn t really within our grasp, but only within His grasp? Falling to Heaven is an account of a gospel that s specifically designed to change our minds and transform our hearts. It is an account of the truths of Christ that really do set us free.</p><p>James L. Ferrell was born and raised in Seattle, Washington.

He has authored several bestselling books, including The Peacegiver, The Holy Secret, and The Hidden Christ. He currently serves in a stake presidency.

Inspired by stories of the aphrodisiac powers of the Sudanese blister beetle, the palpable seductiveness of the lovely Yasmin Howcomely, and the scientific know-how of Professor A. R. Woresley, Uncle Oswald anticipates the concept of the Nobel sperm bank by some 40 years, flimflamming crowned heads, great artists, and eccentric geniuses into making "donations."

Its author, Carl Dair (1912&#x2013;1967) was one of Canada&#x2019;s best-known and most celebrated type compositors and designers.</p><p>Discussing type as a design material as well as a means of communication, Dair argued that if type is understood in terms of design, the user of type will be better able to work with it to achieve maximum clarity and aesthetic pleasure. He guides the reader through a study of typography that starts with the examination of an individual letter and proceeds with words, lines, and masses of text.</p><p>Dair details the main design elements of type &#x2013; size, weight, structure, form, colour, direction, and texture &#x2013; and illustrates the applications of typography in books, advertising, magazines, and other printed forms. The various schools of typography are discussed and the book includes over 150 examples of imaginative typography from around the world.</p><p><em>Design with Type</em> is a classic work in a field of design that continues to flourish.

A boy comes of age in a small wooden house along the Long Wharf, which juts into the harbor, as though reaching for London thousands of miles across the ocean. Sometime in his childhood, he learns to draw.</p><p>That boy was John Singleton Copley, who became, by the 1760s, colonial America&#x2019;s premier painter. His brush captured the faces of his neighbors&#x2015;ordinary men like Paul Revere, John Hancock, and Samuel Adams&#x2015;who would become the revolutionary heroes of a new United States. Today, in museums across America, Copley&#x2019;s brilliant portraits evoke patriotic fervor and rebellious optimism.</p><p>The artist, however, did not share his subjects&#x2019; politics. Copley&#x2019;s nation was Britain; his capital, London. When rebellion sundered Britain&#x2019;s empire, both kin and calling determined the painter&#x2019;s allegiances. He sought the largest canvas for his talents and the safest home for his family. So, by the time the United States declared its independence, Copley and his kin were in London. He painted America&#x2019;s revolution from a far shore, as Britain&#x2019;s American War.</p><p>An intimate portrait of the artist and his extraordinary times, Jane Kamensky&#x2019;s <em>A Revolution in Color</em> masterfully reveals the world of the American Revolution, a place in time riven by divided loyalties and tangled sympathies. Much like the world in which he lived, Copley&#x2019;s life and career were marked by spectacular rises and devastating falls. But though his ambivalence cost him dearly, the painter&#x2019;s achievements in both Britain and America made him a towering figure of both nations&#x2019; artistic legacies.</p> 8 pages of color; 50 illustrations</p><p>Jane Kamensky is professor of history at Harvard University and the Pforzheimer Director of the Schlesinger Library at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. Her many books include A Revolution in Color and The Exchange Artist, a finalist for the George Washington Book Prize.&#x201c;Far from a born partisan, Copley could have gone either way. Kamensky&#x2019;s great accomplishment is to leave readers pulled by different audiences, demands, and political allegiances right along with him.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Caitlin Fitz, <em>The Atlantic</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A memorable journey into the transatlantic world in the age of revolution through a close study of the greatest colonial American artist. Kamensky, a historian with an art historian&#x2019;s sensibility, provides a brilliant survey of John Singleton Copley&#x2019;s life, work, and subjects, vivified by a detailed examination of letters, diaries, and official records, many previously untapped, to involve the reader in the emotional and sensory experience of living in those tumultuous times.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jules Prown, Yale University</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Vivid, intimate, and richly detailed, Jane Kamensky&#x2019;s biography of John Singleton Copley illuminates the deeply intertwined worlds of America and England at the moment of their violent divorce. The career of the great painter from Boston provides a wonderfully fresh and surprising perspective on the American Revolution, on the scope of artistic ambition, and on the high costs of divided loyalty.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Stephen Greenblatt, author of <em>The Swerve</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Jane Kamensky has not only crafted a stunning biography but also a truly singular account of the American Revolution. <em>A Revolution in Color</em> masterfully unravels any easy distinctions between patriots and loyalists.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Amanda Foreman, author of <em>The World Made by Women</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The greatest American artist of the eighteenth century, John Singleton Copley, preferred life in Britain, escaping from the bitter civil war that we call the American Revolution. In this brilliantly insightful and lucidly written biography, Jane Kamensky reveals the age of revolution in fresh new tones as complex and compelling as the interplay of light and shade in the finest Copley painting.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Alan Taylor, author of <em>American Revolutions</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A pleasure to read from first page to last, Jane Kamensky&#x2019;s exploration of the life, work and tumultuous times of John Singleton Copley is itself a masterpiece. Like all excellent portraitists, Kamensky probes deeply into the character of her subject, as deft with the small, revealing detail as she is with the sweeping strokes of landscape and setting. Both gripping narrative history and insightful art criticism, <em>A Revolution in Color</em> is a genre-busting tour de force.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Geraldine Brooks, author of <em>The Secret Chord</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Beautifully written and elegant, <em>A Revolution in Color</em> gives us a vibrant and new perspective on the conflict between America and Great Britain, a conflict the ambitious John Singleton Copley embodied. Jane Kamensky enriches our understanding of this vital time in world history.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Annette Gordon-Reed, author of <em>"Most Blessed of the Patriarchs"</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Richly resourced, prismatic, dynamic, factually and psychologically revelatory, and ebulliently spiked with political insights and ironies, Kamensky&#x2019;s biography provides an intimate view of the American Revolution and its immediate aftermath as seen through the "acute, penetrating" gaze of a masterful artist.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Donna Seaman, <em>Booklist (starred)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;There may never be a better biography of Copley than this sumptuous, exquisitely told story of a man and his time.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews (starred)</em></strong></p><h2>Phantom: The Novel of His Life</h2><p>&#34;Powerful.moving tour de force.&#34; says Publisher&#39;s Weekly, Phantom &#34;adds.new depth to the [original story]..

Finally, a monster stomps down the hall to confront the visitor, only to find a small version of himself. When the trick-or-treater removes his mask, the creatures are so terrified that they flee.

Judy Sierra's The House That Drac Built (Harcourt, 1995) has the same underlying rhythmic structure and also ends with the arrival of trick-or-treaters.

This <em>Companion</em> is packed with 2,650 delightfully written A-Z entries--including 39 feature articles on staple foods--the vast majority penned by the renowned Alan Davidson, with additional articles by over fifty specialists from as far afield as the Philippines, Norway, and Australia. <br> The coverage is spectacular, with the most wide-ranging treatment ever of foods and food products and how to use them. Indeed, the <em>Companion</em> covers everything--plant products, meats, birds and eggs, dairy products, nuts, fish and all seafoods, plant foods, cereals, and exotic foods. Davidson examines famous dishes from around the world--from cassoulet, croque-monsieur, and couscous, to spam, sherbet, and sonofabitch stew. There are over 140 entries on national and regional cuisines (Cajun cooking, Pennsylvania Dutch). Even Antarctica is included in this unique panorama. Other subjects covered in depth include food preservation, culinary terms and techniques, food science and diet, cookbooks and their authors, and the role of food in culture and religion. The book is enhanced by some 180 exquisite illustrations of foods by Laotian artist Soun Vannithone, ranging from the comfortingly familiar to the bizarre and rare. In fact, the common and the exotic mingle throughout, with the everyday (apples, apricots) and the exotic (akee, ambarella, baobab) found side by side. <br> Here then is a true cornucopia, offering all the flavors, styles, and staples of the world, past and present, from classical Greek and Roman cookery to modern Australian and Hawaiian cuisines. Food historians, food scientists, food writers, chefs, restaurateurs, amateur cooks, and everyone with a serious interest in cooking--and eating--will feast on this authoritative reference on food.</p><p>Alan Davidson's <i>Oxford Companion to Food</i> has been over 20 years in the assembling, but here it is; and it is superlatively worth the wait. In fact, superlatives fall silent. A huge and authoritative dictionary of 2,650 entries on just about every conceivable foodstuff, seasoning, cuisine, cooking method, historical survey, significant personage, and explication of myth, it is supplemented by some 40 longer articles on key items. Davidson himself (no relation to this reviewer) contributes approximately 80 percent of the 2,650 entries, thereby guaranteeing high levels of erudition, readability, and deadpan feline wit. Since this is a monument intended to last, nothing so frivolous as a recipe is included. A decision taken early in the development of the project to abjure issues whose significance is largely topical has also ensured an agreeable high-mindedness--nothing on those crucial but essentially dreary topics of BSE and GM foods, for example.<p> If a fault could be found, it would only be that it's often difficult to read to the end of an entry, as the abundant cross-referencing all too easily sends one off to another entry, thence bouncing off to another, and all too soon the original is forgotten. A random alphabet of seductions might include: Aardvark, Botulism, Cup Cake, David (Elizabeth), Enzymes, Fat-Tailed Sheep, Gender/Sex and Food, Hallucinogenic Mushrooms, Ice Cream Sundae, Jewish Dietary Laws, Kangaroos, Lobscouse, Microwave Cooking, Norway, Offal, Puffin, Queen of Puddings, Roti, Scurvy, Termite Heap Mushroom (or Taillevant), Umeboshi, Vegetarianism, Washing up (a very elegant little article), sadly no X, Yin-yang, and Zabaglione. As this might show, Alan Davidson's aim, borrowed from Dumas's great <i>Grand Dictionnaire de Cuisine</i>, that his work would appeal not only to persons of "serious character" but also those "of a much lighter disposition," is utterly fulfilled. <i>--Robin Davidson, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><br><strong>Alan Davidson</strong> is a distinguished author and publisher, and one of the world's best-known writers on fish and fish cookery. In 1975 he retired from the Diplomatic Service--after serving in, amongst other places, Washington, Egypt, Tunisia, and Laos, where he was British Ambassador--to pursue a fruitful third career (his first was in the Navy in World War II) as a food historian and food writer <em>extraordinaire</em>.

The conventional wisdom is that the West first experienced religious decline, followed by the decline of the family. Eberstadt turns this standard account on its head. Marshalling an impressive array of research, from fascinating historical data on family decline in pre-Revolutionary France to contemporary popular culture both in the United States and Europe, Eberstadt shows that the reverse has also been true: the undermining of the family has further undermined Christianity itself.&nbsp;Drawing on sociology, history, demography, theology, literature, and many other sources, Eberstadt shows that family decline and religious decline have gone hand in hand in the Western world in a way that has not been understood before&#x2014;that they are, as she puts it in a striking new image summarizing the book&#x2019;s thesis, &#x201c;the double helix of society, each dependent on the strength of the other for successful reproduction.&#x201d;&nbsp;In sobering final chapters, Eberstadt then lays out the enormous ramifications of the mutual demise of family and faith in the West. While it is fashionable in some circles to applaud the decline both of religion and the nuclear family, there are, as Eberstadt reveals, enormous social, economic, civic, and other costs attendant on both declines. Her conclusion considers this tantalizing question: whether the economic and demographic crisis now roiling Europe and spreading to America will have the inadvertent result of reviving the family as the most viable alternative to the failed welfare state&#x2014;fallout that could also lay the groundwork for a religious revival as well.&nbsp;<i>How the West Really Lost God</i> is both a startlingly original account of how secularization happens and a&nbsp;sweeping brief about why everyone should care. A book written for agnostics as well as believers, atheists as well as &#x201c;none of the above,&#x201d; it will permanently change the way every reader understands the two institutions that have hitherto undergirded Western civilization as we know it&#x2014;family and faith&#x2014;and the real nature of the relationship between those two pillars of history.&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Mary Eberstadt</b> is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.

Last</b>, author of What to Expect When No One's Expecting: America's Coming Demographic Disaster<br><br> &#x201c;How the West Really Lost God&#x201d; is a clear, compelling and ultimately convincing presentation of the relationship between faith and family. It&#x2019;s not a call to action. But it doesn&#x2019;t need to be. The Church has already told Christians what to do. The book just dispels any lingering doubts about the necessity of doing&nbsp;it. &#x2014;Emily Stimpson, <i>Our Sunday Visitor</i><p>&#x201c;Every Christian leader who&#x2019;s interested in engaging today&#x2019;s culture (and who shouldn&#x2019;t be?) should have this book on his or her desk. Her research and historical perspectives are fascinating, and I&#x2019;m confident that she&#x2019;ll give you enormous new information that will help you engage today&#x2019;s non-believing culture more&nbsp;effectively.&#x201d; &#x2014;Phil&nbsp;Cooke, <i>The Christian News Journal </i></p><br><br>&#x201c;Mary Eberstadt&#x2019;s account of the synergistic relationship between the fracturing of the family and declining religiosity is both chilling and utterly convincing. No theorist of secularization has come close to Eberstadt in sociological insight or explanatory&nbsp;power.&#x201d;&#x2014; <b><i>Mary Ann Glendon</i></b>, author of <i>The Forum and the Tower: How Scholars and Politicians Have Imagined the World from Plato to Eleanor&nbsp;Roosevelt </i><br><br>&#x201c;A brilliant contribution to the really big question about the future of the West, and a pleasure to read.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i><b>Rodney Stark</b></i>, author of <i>The Rise of Christianity</i><br><br>"Mary Eberstadt's &nbsp;account of the connection between religion and family, showing that the two institutions rise and fall together, is finely written, impressively argued and entirely persuasive. This book tells us much about the condition of Western societies today and reminds us that the atheists and the Nietzscheans owe their influence less to the truth of their views than to the loneliness to which they appeal." &#x2014;<i><b>Roger Scruton</b></i>, author of <i>The West and the Rest</i>: <i>Globalisation and the Terrorist Threat</i><br>"Mary Eberstadt is one of the most acute and creative social observers of our time. She is not afraid to challenge received wisdom and her insights are always well worth pondering."&#x2014;<i><b>Francis Fukuyama</b></i>, author of <i>The End of History and the Last Man</i><br>"In <i>How the West Really Lost God</i>, Mary Eberstadt paints a provocative and powerful portrait of the familial roots of contemporary secularization in the West. Recent declines in church attendance throughout Europe and the Americas have been driven in large part by declining rates of marriage and childbearing among their citizens. Apparently, when men and women cease to find their way to the altar and the maternity ward, they are less likely to look heavenwards. As Eberstadt notes, the decline of faith and family have gone hand in hand throughout the West.&nbsp;&#x201c;This spells trouble for the men and women of the West, insofar as the one other institution besides family and religion that now supports them from cradle to grave is the welfare state. But, from Greece to the United States, the welfare state is running out of money. Eberstadt speculates that the demographic and financial collapse may well spur a revival of the fortunes of faith and family as people come to realize they cannot rely on the state. Only time will tell."&nbsp;&#x2014;<i><b>W. Bradford Wilcox</b></i>, director of National Marriage Project, University of Virginia &nbsp;<br>"<i>How the West Really Lost God</i> is clear as a bell, beautifully plotted, and the point it makes not only overturns conventional wisdom but strikes far deeper into reality than any rival argument in the field." &#x2014;<i><b>Michael Novak,</b></i> author of&nbsp;<i>The Myth of Romantic Love, No One Sees God, Belief and Unbelief</i><br>"Her short, elegantly written book repeatedly shows that strong families help to keep religious practice alive, and that too many people see a causal connection running exclusively in the opposite direction."&#x2014;<b><i>The Economist</i></b>, 4/27/2013<br><br>&#x201c;A short column cannot do justice to the wide and deep reading and all the evidence Eberstadt has marshaled for her argument, so you are urged to read this book. What is certain is that this is one of those books that will forever change the conversation about why Christianity is in decline in the West.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Crisis Magazine</i>&nbsp;&#x201c;In her deeply insightful new book, <i>How the West Really Lost God</i>,&nbsp;Mary Eberstadt&nbsp;suggests that there is a more fundamental cause underlying the cultural loss of religion&#x2014;a cause that all the previous research has mistaken for just another effect. What if the decline of religion is integrally connected to, and perhaps even a result of, the decline of the natural family?&#x201d;&nbsp; &#x2014;<i>Washington Times</i><br><br></p><h2>The Traveler&#39;s Key To Ancient Egypt</h2><p>Detailed information to the art and architechture of the sacred sites of ancient Egypt--including the pyramids, the sphinx, tombs, and temples--and of items in the Cairo and Luxor museums also provides in-depth coverage of modern Egyptology</p><p></p><h2>Rodale&#39;s Encyclopedia of Natural Home Remedies: Hundreds of Simple Healing Techniques for Everyday Illness and Emergencies</h2><p>Today's home remedies reflect the tenor of our own time, with its high regard for good nutrition, good living habits and good medical care, along with an appreciation of the importance of individual differences, safety in all remedies (medical and non-medical) and &#x2013; yes &#x2013; convenience, too.

[with] elements of Darcy, Heathcliff, Rhett Butler and Robin Hood Author: Debbie HorsfieldFrom the incomparable Winston Graham . . . who has everything that anyone else has, then a whole lot more. Source: Guardian From the Author Winston</p><p>Winston Graham was the author of forty novels. His books have been widely translated and his famous series has been developed into two television series shown in 24 countries. Winston Graham was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and in 1983 was awarded the OBE.<p>From Chapter 1</p> <p>There could have been prophecy in the storm that blew up at the time of Julia's birth.</p> <p>May month was not a time for heavy gales, but the climate of Cornwall is capri�cious as any child ever born. It had been a kindly enough spring, as kindly as the summer and winter that had gone before it; mild, soft, comfortable weather; and the land was already heavy with green things. Then May broke rainy and gusty, and the blossom suffered here and there and the hay leaned about looking for support.</p> <p>On the night of the fifteenth, Demelza felt her first pains. Even then for a while she gripped the bedpost and thought the matter all round before she said anything. All along she had viewed the coming ordeal with a calm and philosophical mind and had never troubled Ross with false alarms. She did not want to begin so late. Last evening she had been out in her beloved garden, digging round the young plants; then as it was going dark she had found a disgruntled hedgehog and had played with him, trying to persuade him to take some bread and milk, and had only come in reluctantly as the sky clouded and it went cold.</p> <p>This now-this thing in the middle of the night-might yet be only the result of getting overtired.</p> <p>But when it began to feel as if someone was kneeling on her backbone and trying to break it, she knew it was not.</p> <p>She touched Ross's arm and he woke instantly.</p> <p>"Well?"</p> <p>"I think," she said, "I think you will have to fetch Prudie."</p> <p>He sat up. "Why? What is it?"</p> <p>"I have a pain."</p> <p>"Where? Do you mean..."</p> <p>"I have a pain," she said primly. "I think twould be as well to fetch Prudie."</p> <p>He climbed quickly out of bed, and she listened to the scratch of flint and steel. After a moment the tinder caught and he lit a candle. The room flickered into view: heavy teak beams, the curtain over the door moving gently in the breeze, the low window seat hung with pink grogram, her shoes as she had kicked them off, one wooden sole upmost, Joshua's spyglass, Ross's pipe, Ross's book, and a fly crawling.</p> <p>He looked at her and at once knew the truth. She smiled a pallid apology. He went across to the table by the door and poured her a glass of brandy.</p> <p>"Drink this. I will send Jud for Dr. Choake." He began to pull on his clothes, anyhow.</p> <p>"No, no, Ross; do not send yet. It is the middle of the night. He will be asleep."</p> <p>Whether Thomas Choake should be called in to her had been a dissension between them for some weeks. Demelza could not forget that twelve months ago she had been a maidservant and that Choake, though only a physician, owned a small estate which, even if it had been bought with his wife's money, put him on a level from which the likes of her would be seen as unimportant chattels. That was until Ross married her. Since then she had grown to her position. She could put on a show of refinement and good manners, and not at all a bad show at that, but a doctor was different. A doctor caught one at a disadvantage. If the pain was bad, she would almost certainly swear in the old way she had learned from her father, not a few genteel "damn mes" and "by Gods," as anyone might excuse from a lady in trouble. To have a baby and be forced to act genteel at the same time was more than Demelza could look forward to.</p> <p>Besides, she didn't want a man about. It wasn't decent. Her cousin-in-law, Elizabeth, had had him, but Elizabeth was an aristocrat born and bred, and they looked at things different. <i>She </i>would far rather have had old Aunt Betsy Triggs from Mellin, who sold pilchards and was a rare strong hand when it came to babies.</p> <p>But Ross was the more determined and he had had his way. She was not unprepared for his curt, "Then he shall be woke," as he left the room.</p> <p><i>"Ross!" </i>She called him back. For the moment the pain had gone.</p> <p>"Yes?" His strong, scarred, introspective face was half lit by the candle; the upgrowing dark hair was ruffled and hardly showed its hint of copper; his shirt was open at the throat. This man...aristocrat of them all, she thought...this man, so reserved and reserving, with whom she had shared rare intimacy.</p> <p>"Would you?" she said. "Before you go..."</p> <p>He came back to the bed. The emergency had come on him so quickly in his sleep that he had had no time yet to feel anything but alarm that her time was here and relief that it might soon be over. As he kissed her he saw the moisture on her face and a worm of fear and compassion moved in him. He took her face in his hands, pushed back the black hair, and stared a moment into the dark eyes of his young wife. They were not dancing and mischievous as they so often were, but there was no fear in them.</p> <p>"I'll be back. In a moment I'll be back."</p> <p>She made a gesture of dissent. "Don't come back, Ross. Go and tell Prudie, that's all. I'd rather-you didn't see me like this."</p> <p>"And what of Verity? You specially wanted Verity here."</p> <p>"Tell her in the morning. Tisn't fair to bring her out in the night air. Send for her in the morning."</p> <p>He kissed her again.</p> <p>"Tell me that you love me, Ross," she said.</p> <p>He looked at her in surprise.</p> <p>"You know I do!"</p> <p>"And say you don't love Elizabeth."</p> <p>"And I don't love Elizabeth." What else was he to say when he did not know the truth himself? He was not a man who spoke his inmost feelings easily, but now he saw himself powerless to help her, and only words of his and not actions would give her aid. "Nothing else matters but you," he said. "Remember that. All my relatives and friends-and Elizabeth, and this house and the mine...I'd throw them in the dust and you know it-and you know it. If you don't know it, then all these months I've failed and no words I can give you now will make it otherwise. I love you, Demelza, and we've had such happiness. And we're going to have it again. Take hold of that, my sweet. Hold it and keep it, for no one else can."</p> <p>"I'll hold it, Ross," she said, content because the words had come.</p> <p>He kissed her again and turned and lit more candles, took up one, and went quickly out of the room, the hot grease running over his hand. The wind had dropped since yesterday; there was only a breeze. He did not know the time, but it felt about two.</p> <p>He pushed open the door on the other side of the landing and went across to the bedroom where Jud and Prudie slept. The ill-fitting bedroom door opened with a long squeak, which merged into Prudie's slow rasping snore. He grunted in disgust, for the hot, close, sweaty smell offended his nose. The night air might be dangerous, but they could surely open the window during the day and let this stink out.</p> <p>He went across and parted the curtains and shook Jud by the shoulders. Jud's two great teeth showed like gravestones. He shook again, violently. Jud's nightcap came off and a spot of the candle grease fell on his bald patch. Jud woke. He began to curse; then he saw who it was and sat up rubbing his head.</p> <p>"What's amiss?"</p> <p>"Demelza is ill." How call her anything but Demelza to a man who had been here when she came as a tattered waif of thirteen? "I want you to go for Dr. Choake at once. And wake Prudie. She will be wanted too."</p> <p>"What's amiss with her?"</p> <p>"Her pains have begun." </p></p><h2>A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia (Rosenwald Collection Reprint Series)</h2><p>Reprint of 1590 edition, with 28 engravings by de Bry (from John White) of Indian villages, activities, dress, more.

The Confederate Army of Northern Virginia is invading the North. General Robert E. Lee has made this daring and massive move with seventy thousand men in a determined effort to draw out the Union Army of the Potomac and mortally wound it. His right hand is General James Longstreet, a brooding man who is loyal to Lee but stubbornly argues against his plan. Opposing them is an unknown factor: General George Meade, who has taken command of the Army only two days before what will be perhaps the crucial battle of the Civil War.<br><br> In the four most bloody and courageous days of our nation&#x2019;s history, two armies fight for two conflicting dreams. One dreams of freedom, the other of a way of life. More than rifles and bullets are carried into battle. The soldiers carry memories. Promises. Love. And more than men fall on those Pennsylvania fields. Bright futures, untested innocence, and pristine beauty are also the casualties of war.<br><br> <i>The Killer Angels</i> is unique, sweeping, unforgettable&#x2013;a dramatic re-creation of the battleground for America&#x2019;s destiny.</p><p>This novel reveals more about the Battle of Gettysburg than any piece of learned nonfiction on the same subject. Michael Shaara&#39;s account of the three most important days of the Civil War features deft characterizations of all of the main actors, including Lee, Longstreet, Pickett, Buford, and Hancock. The most inspiring figure in the book, however, is Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, whose 20th Maine regiment of volunteers held the Union&#39;s left flank on the second day of the battle. This unit&#39;s bravery at Little Round Top helped turned the tide of the war against the rebels. There are also plenty of maps, which convey a complete sense of what happened July 1-3, 1863. Reading about the past is rarely so much fun as on these pages.It's hard to limit myself when talking about this book because it is simply one of the best books I've ever read. But it wasn't until the second reading that I appreciated this. I read it in college, among the million other books an English major must read, and I liked it. Then, when we published Gods and Generals, I figured I'd read Killer Angels again, just to refresh my memory. And it was if I'd never read it before. Names and places that had simply been history before now took on new meaning and importance. It gave me a whole new understanding of the Civil War and the why's of it all. Killer Angels is simply a book that everyone should read.<br>Lisa Congelosi, Ballantine Sales Rep.</p><h2>Why Honor Matters</h2><p><b>A controversial call to put honor at the center of morality</b><br>To the modern mind, the idea of honor is outdated, sexist, and barbaric. It evokes Hamilton and Burr and pistols at dawn, not visions of a well-organized society. But for philosopher Tamler Sommers, a sense of honor is essential to living moral lives. In <i>Why Honor Matters</i>, Sommers argues that our collective rejection of honor has come at great cost. Reliant only on Enlightenment liberalism, the United States has become the home of the cowardly, the shameless, the selfish, and the alienated. Properly channeled, honor encourages virtues like courage, integrity, and solidarity, and gives a sense of living for something larger than oneself. Sommers shows how honor can help us address some of society's most challenging problems, including education, policing, and mass incarceration. Counterintuitive and provocative, <i>Why Honor Matters</i> makes a convincing case for honor as a cornerstone of our modern society.<br></p><p><b>Tamler Sommers</b> is an associate professor of philosophy at the University of Houston. He is the host of the podcast "Very Bad Wizards" and the author of two previous books. Sommers holds a PhD in philosophy from Duke University.

Cramer and Sara-Beth Plummer </i> </p> <p>DISABILITY: DEFINITIONS, PREVALENCE, AND THEORIES</p> <p>According to the National Violence Against Women Survey, three times as many women as men experience physical assault by an intimate partner during their lifetime (21% vs. 7%, respectively) (Tjaden and Thoennes 2000). Depending on its definition, annual incidents of violence toward women range from 837,899 (National Crime Victim Survey) to 6.25 million (National Family Violence Survey) (Gelles 2000). When one considers nonphysical abuse -- emotional abuse, threats, and controlling behaviors -- the numbers increase for both men and women. When one includes abuse directed toward the disabled, the number rises. Until recently, little research or scholarship has focused on a population of women and men who are at great risk of being abused: persons with disabilities.</p> <p>The term "disability" has many definitions. Some consider "disability" within a medical-diagnostic context, which generally implies medical or psychological treatment as well as accommodations for activities of daily living. Those that view disability as a medical condition (within and outside the disability community) adopt particular terms: "people with X," with X referring to the condition (e.g., people with multiple sclerosis, people with a hearing impairment). They also may use the disability as a noun to describe the person, particularly regarding mental illness (e.g., "He's a schizophrenic"). Others view disability as a "set of limitations imposed on individuals (with or even without diagnosed medical conditions) from external factors such as social, cultural, and other environmental influences" (DePoy and Gilson 2004, p. 4). Those adhering to the second or constructed view of disability may choose, for example, to refer to people as disabled -- not because the person has an intrinsic condition but rather because the environment disables people from functioning to their fullest potential. Others may reject the idea that a disability needs to be "fixed" or "cured" in order for individuals to live good and meaningful lives (e.g., cochlear implants for deaf children).</p> <p>The Americans with Disabilities Act defines a person as having a disability "if s/he has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, has a record of such impairment, or is regarded as having such an impairment" (U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 2002, p. 6). According to the 2000 U.S. Census (Waldrop and Stern 2003), 49.7 million noninstitutionalized civilians aged 5 and over reported some type of enduring condition or disability; this represents one-fifth of the population. The percentage of persons reporting disabilities is highest for adults 65 years old and older, who account for 42 percent of the disabled.</p> <p>One theory about disability is referred to as Explanatory Legitimacy Theory (ELT) (DePoy and Gilson 2004; Gilson, DePoy, and Cramer 2003). Three interactive elements comprise this theory: "description," "explanation," and "legitimacy." To illustrate, we provide two hypothetical situations, using Ed and Becky. "Description" includes what people do and do not do, and how they do it. Ed and Becky both slur their words when they speak. This type of speaking would be considered "atypical" (not of the norm or considered normal) and observable. The "explanation" for why each individual slurs his or her words, however, may differ. Ed's word slurring may be explained by his cerebral palsy, a medical diagnosis, whereas Becky's slurring is explained by blood-alcohol levels. Ed's slurring his words fits within a "legitimate value framework" (i.e., caused by a medical condition through no fault of his own). Consequently the responses to him may focus on what treatments or therapies may enable him to communicate slurring fewer words (i.e., more "normally"). The judgment and response to Becky from some individuals, however, may be quite different based on the explanation for Becky's word slurring -- her misuse of alcohol. Whereas Ed may be viewed as a person with a disability (CP) whose condition causes various atypical characteristics, Becky may be termed a "drunk," engendering a response such as removing her from the premises. In this example, one person (Ed) would be legitimized as disabled, and the other (Becky) would not be considered disabled.</p> <p>PREVALENCE OF ABUSE OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES</p> <p>The number of men and women with disabilities who are abused appears similar to or higher than others. One U.S. study comparing lifetime prevalence rates of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse of women with disabilities with other women found that both groups had experienced such abuse -- 62 percent, respectively (Young et al. 1997); husbands or live-in partners were most commonly the perpetrators. Compared to other women, women with disabilities experience abuse for a longer duration, by a greater number of perpetrators, and more frequently at the hands of health-care workers and personal care attendants. They also have fewer options for leaving the abusive situation (Young et al. 1997).</p> <p>A study of women attending family practice clinics in the U.S. reported that women with disabilities were more than twice as likely to report intimate partner violence (IPV) than women without disabilities (Coker, Smith, and Fadden 2005). A recent study of women in North Carolina found similar rates of physical assault for women with and women without disabilities, although those with disabilities had four times the odds of experiencing sexual assault in the past year than others (Martin et al. 2006).</p> <p>A Canadian study demonstrated higher rates of physical, sexual, emotional, and financial abuse among women with activity limitations compared to other women (Cohen et al. 2006). Persons with activity limitations were defined as "those with difficulties in activities of daily living or persons who have a physical or mental condition or health problem that limits the kind or amount of activities they can perform" (p. 1). In this same study, men with activity limitations showed greater rates of physical, emotional, and financial abuse than other men. Women who had activity limitations were more likely to experience a form of intimate partner violence, and more frequently and severely, compared to men who had activity limitations. This difference, however, disappeared when factoring in socio-demographic variables for the analysis (i.e., age, marital status, income, and self-rated health status).</p> <p>A recent Canadian study of 7,027 women found that disabled women had 40 percent greater odds of experiencing violence (physical assault, physical threat, or sexual assault) committed by a marital or common-law partner in the preceding five years compared to other women. Furthermore, the disabled women were more at risk for severe violence (Brownridge 2006). The author identified patriarchal dominance and sexual jealousy and possessiveness as perpetrator characteristics, or risk markers, for violence against this female population.</p> <p>It has also been suggested that the risks of abuse increase for women living in institutional settings (Chenoweth 1996; Sobsey 1994). Personal Assistance Service providers are also known to abuse women and men with disabilities (Oktay and Tompkins 2004; Saxton et al. 2001).</p> <p>Being abused may cause short- or long-term disabling conditions for men and women, such as head and traumatic brain injuries (Banks and Ackerman 2002; Jackson et al. 2002); chronic pain syndromes (Kendall-Tackett, Marshall, and Ness 2003); and neurological impairments as a result of strangulation (Wilbur et al. 2001). Coker et al. (2005) found that all types of IPV (physical assault, sexual assault, and psychological/emotional abuse) were associated with having a disability. They note that IPV may lead to disabilities "indirectly through distress and adverse lifestyle or coping strategies.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Some IPV-associated disability is the result of an injury, but most IPV-associated disability results from women's long-term exposure to chronic abuse.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [I]ndirect effects of both physical and psychological IPV may be more important than the direct physical injuries that many abused women experience" (p. 834).</p> <p>CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS FOR UNDERSTANDING ABUSE OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES</p> <p>Several researchers have offered conceptual frameworks for understanding abuse of persons with disabilities. An ecological model helps us to understand and address the abuse of the disabled population (Sobsey 1994). This model includes the vulnerability of persons with disabilities to be abused, partly owing to limited physical and cognitive skills; increased isolation because of interactions and relationships that encourage physical and emotional dependency; and the tendency of those who work with persons with disabilities to exhibit a need for power and control, and to take positions intentionally in institutions that offer opportunities to abuse. Dehumanization, depersonalization, and devaluation of persons with disabilities add to the continuation of abuse.</p> <p>The concepts "silence" and "paradox" have also been used to help explain the abuse of individuals with disabilities (Chenoweth 1996). "Silence" is based on the overall societal denial of the prevalence of abuse of the disabled population. Abuse of these individuals is often not discussed and, when encountered, is routinely ignored. The "paradoxes" include the overprotection, segregation, and trained compliance of individuals with disabilities, with the simultaneous expectations of either asexual or promiscuous behavior among disabled women. In an attempt to protect individuals with disabilities, we inadvertently facilitate situations that increase the potential for abuse by fostering vulnerability through isolation, limiting autonomy, and encouraging learned compliance.</p> <p>Another construct for understanding abuse of persons with disabilities is "limitation" (Cramer, Gilson, and D...</p></p><h2>One Putt: The Ultimate Guide to Perfect Putting</h2><p><p> Ken Brown shows golfers in clear language and photographs how to excel on the putting green.

The tips, drills and glib anecdotes come printed in large type with easy-to-follow instructions. The eye-over-the-ball section is inspired, and there's even a flicker sequence to riffle through! The high-quality photos and illustrations never get overly technical as they reinforce Brown's enlightened approach. The shots of famous pros putting are not included gratuitously; rather, we learn what makes them money on the greens. One Putt helps you appreciate [that] the hard work involved in becoming a great putter doesn't have to feel like work at all."

And on fire. </p><p>She tried to shake the burning two-by-four off her leg but it was too heavy. It wouldn&#x2019;t budge. She tried shoving it away and managed to move it a little, but in the process her hand caught fire as well.

Jance</p><p><b></b></p><b><b>CHAPTER 1</b></b> <p>On a gorgeous mid-May morning with temperatures still in the seventies, all was right with Ali Reynolds&#x2019;s world. The cobalt blue sky overhead was unblemished by even a single cloud, and Sedona&#x2019;s towering red rocks gleamed in brilliant sunlight. </p><p>The seemingly endless remodeling project on Ali&#x2019;s recently purchased Manzanita Hills Road house had finally come to an end. The workers were gone, along with their trucks and their constant noise. Now, seated on her newly refurbished flagstone patio and surrounded by an ancient wisteria in full and glorious bloom, she was enjoying the peace and quiet, as well as a third cup of freshly brewed coffee, while she worked on a speech, a commencement speech actually, that she was due to deliver at not one but two high school graduation ceremonies at the end of the week. </p><p>How she had gotten roped into doing two commencement speeches one day apart was a wonder to her still. </p><p>A year or so earlier Ali had agreed to take the helm of the Amelia Dougherty Askins Scholarship Fund, a charitable entity that helped provide financial assistance for college expenses to deserving students from schools all over Arizona&#x2019;s Verde Valley. Though she was once an Askins Scholarship winner herself, this was Ali&#x2019;s first year of administering the program. The time-consuming process of searching out and evaluating likely recipients had put her in touch with students, teachers, and administrators from a number of local schools. </p><p>Ali&#x2019;s ties to Sedona Red Rock High School had to do with the fact that both her son, Christopher, and her new daughter-in-law, Chris&#x2019;s bride, Athena, taught there. When it came time to cajole Ali into agreeing to speak at commencement, her son and daughter-in-law had known just which strings to pull. </p><p>Although Sedona was Ali&#x2019;s hometown, Sedona Red Rock wasn&#x2019;t her actual alma mater, since there had been no high school in Sedona at the time Ali was an eligible student. Instead, Ali and her classmates had been bused to nearby Cottonwood, where they had attended Mingus Union High School and where Ali&#x2019;s favorite teacher had been the head of the English department, a gruff but caring character named Ernie Gabrielson. Once word leaked out that Ali had been scheduled to speak at Sedona&#x2019;s graduation ceremonies, a delegation had been sent requesting that Ali do the same for Mingus. Hence the two separate invitations. The two events, however, required only one speech, and Ali had been working on it for several days. </p><p>She wanted her talk to be fun and meaningful. Ali had graduated from high school and gone away to college. After obtaining her degree in journalism, she had gone off to work in the world of television news, first reporting and then anchoring newscasts in Milwaukee, New York City, and finally L.A. She had returned to her hometown in the aftermath of losing both her anchor position and her philandering husband, Paul Grayson. Her initial intention had been to stay in Sedona just long enough to regroup, but now she had settled back into small-town life and was reveling in it. She was glad to be out of the constant hustle and bustle and traffic of L.A., and she was enjoying living close to her parents and her son. </p><p>That was part of what she wanted to say to the graduates later this week, on Thursday evening in Sedona and on Friday in Cottonwood&#x2014;that it was fine for students to leave home in order to further their educations and make their marks in the big, wide world&#x2014;but she also wanted to tell them that it was fine for them to stay at home or to come back home eventually, bringing with them the benefit of both their education and their hard-won experience, which they could then apply to problems and opportunities that existed in their own backyards. </p><p>Lost in thought and concentrating on the work at hand, Ali was surprised when her majordomo, Leland Brooks, cleared his throat and announced, &#x201c;Excuse me, madam, but you have a visitor.&#x201d; </p><p>For the better part of fifty years, Leland had managed the house on Manzanita Hills Road, first for the previous owner, Arabella Ashcroft, and for her mother. Now he did the same thing for the new owner. During Ali&#x2019;s massive remodeling project he had served as the on-site supervisor. Now he mostly supervised Ali. She didn&#x2019;t require much supervision, but she&#x2019;d grown too fond of Leland Brooks to consider putting him out to pasture. </p><p>Ali looked up in time to realize that the guest in question, Gordon Maxwell, had followed Leland onto the patio. Maxwell was sheriff of Yavapai County, and he certainly looked the part. He was dressed in a crisply starched khaki uniform and held a white Stetson gripped in one hand. A loaded pistol, a 9-millimeter Smith and Wesson M&amp;P in its molded scabbard, was strapped to his right hip. Weaponry aside, he looked like a man who could handle himself. </p><p>For one thing, he was large. The heels on his highly polished snakeskin cowboy boots added an extra inch or so to his barefoot height of six foot six. Ali estimated him to be somewhere in his early sixties, but he had the physique and carriage of a much younger man. If he had worn the Stetson instead of carrying it around, it would have completed the impression of youthfulness by covering his bald head. On his chest was a silver star and a name tag that said <i>Sheriff Maxwell.</i> The presence of that white hat, worn or not, served notice to one and all that Gordon Maxwell was one of the good guys. </p><p>&#x201c;Morning, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; he drawled in greeting. &#x201c;Hope you don&#x2019;t mind my dropping by unannounced like this.&#x201d; </p><p>Ali could tell from the disapproving frown on Leland&#x2019;s forehead that her butler most certainly minded. In Leland Brooks&#x2019;s world, well-mannered guests never dropped by uninvited; it simply wasn&#x2019;t done. Sheriff Maxwell, however, had apparently failed to get that particular memo. Ali knew that since the sheriff lived miles away in Prescott, the county seat, he couldn&#x2019;t exactly claim that he was simply in the neighborhood and decided to drop in. No, he had come to see Ali on purpose, and he hadn&#x2019;t called in advance because he was worried she might try to dodge him. </p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Ali said at once, clearing her laptop out of the way. &#x201c;Of course not. Please have a seat. Would you care for coffee?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; Maxwell said. &#x201c;A cup of coffee would be greatly appreciated.&#x201d; With that he eased his lanky frame into one of the empty patio chairs and then set his hat carefully, with the crown down, on the seat of another. </p><p>Ali nodded in Leland&#x2019;s direction. With only the smallest disapproving shake of his head, the butler picked up Ali&#x2019;s empty mug and bustled off to fetch coffee while Ali turned to her visitor. </p><p>&#x201c;To what do I owe this honor?&#x201d; she asked. </p><p>Sheriff Maxwell looked both thoughtful and uncomfortable at the same time. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s to whom,&#x201d; he said finally, with the kind of carefully chosen grammar that would have done Mr. Gabrielson proud. &#x201c;Not to what. And the real answer to your question would be your friend Detective Holman. I suppose he&#x2019;s told you that my department has been through a bit of a rough patch recently.&#x201d; </p><p>It was true that Dave Holman had mentioned the sheriff&#x2019;s department&#x2019;s difficulties, but so had everyone else. The story had been the talk of the town, from the Sedona post office to the lunch counter at the Sugarloaf Cafe, a neighborhood diner run by Ali&#x2019;s parents, Bob and Edie Larson. </p><p>According to local gossip, a longtime evidence clerk named Sally Harrison had come under suspicion of hijacking some of the drugs that had been left in her charge. When the alleged thefts finally became known, her boyfriend, Devon Ryan, a deputy who not only happened to be the department&#x2019;s media information officer but was also still married to someone else at the time, had decked an overly inquisitive reporter from the Flagstaff daily newspaper, the<i> Coconino Courier....</i></p></p><h2>Nutritional Anthropology: Biocultural Perspectives on Food and Nutrition</h2><p>Revised for the first time in ten years, the second edition of <em>Nutritional Anthropology: Biocultural Perspectives on Food and Nutrition </em>continues to blend biological and cultural approaches to this dynamic discipline. <br><br>While this revision maintains the format and philosophy that grounded the first edition, the text has been revamped and revitalized with new and updated readings, sections, introductions, and pedagogical materials that cover current global food trade and persistent problems of hunger in equal measure. <br><br>Unlike any other book on the market, <em>Nutritional Anthropology </em>fuses issues past and present, local and global, and biological and cultural in order to give students a comprehensive foundation in food and nutrition.<br></p><p><br><strong>Darna L.

Bourdieu develops a forceful critique of traditional approaches to language, including the linguistic theories of Saussure and Chomsky and the theory of speech-acts elaborated by Austin and others. He argues that language should be viewed not only as a means of communication but also as a medium of power through which individuals pursue their own interests and display their practical competence.</p><p>Drawing on the concepts that are part of his distinctive theoretical approach, Bourdieu maintains that linguistic utterances or expressions can be understood as the product of the relation between a &#x201c;linguistic market&#x201d; and a &#x201c;linguistic habitus.&#x201d; When individuals use language in particular ways, they deploy their accumulated linguistic resources and implicitly adapt their words to the demands of the social field or market that is their audience. Hence every linguistic interaction, however personal or insignificant it may seem, bears the traces of the social structure that it both expresses and helps to reproduce.</p><p>Bourdieu&#x2019;s account sheds fresh light on the ways in which linguistic usage varies according to considerations such as class and gender. It also opens up a new approach to the ways in which language is used in the domain of politics. For politics is, among other things, the arena in which words are deeds and the symbolic character of power is at stake.</p><p>This volume, by one of the leading social thinkers in the world today, represents a major contribution to the study of language and power.

It was not until 1949 that the French courts removed the ban originally imposed on Baudelaire's masterpiece.<br>Today, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> is regarded as the poet's greatest work and perhaps the most influential book of French poetry ever written. In assessing Baudelaire's importance in literature, Wallace Fowlie, distinguished scholar, critic and Baudelaire specialist, describes him as "the poet and thinker of our age, of what we like to call modernity."<br>This handsome dual-language edition combines <i>Flowers of Evil</i> with a selection of the poet's other significant compositions, including prose poems from <i>Spleen of Paris</i>, a poignant collection reflecting Baudelaire's pessimism towards the teeming city and his compassion for its less successful inhabitants. Readers will also find critical essays on art, music and literature, including a discussion of Edgar Allan Poe's poetry; and Baudelaire's personal letters to his mother and female acquaintances. Edited and translated by Professor Fowlie, this authoritative edition contains excellent line-by-line English translations with the original French text on the facing pages.<br>Students of French language and literature as well as poetry lovers with some knowledge of French will welcome this volume by one of the greatest European poets of the 19th century.</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>The Wizard of Karres</h2><p>At last-the sequel to <i>The Witches of Karres</i>. Three top writers continue the bewitching adventures begun in one of science fiction's most beloved novels. First time in paperback.<br><br>It just wasn't fair! Captain Pausert had foiled the deadliest of space pirates and eliminated the threat of the Worm World, yet his troubles kept piling up. Sent on a secret mission to stop the nanite plague, a self-aware disease that could devastate whole worlds, he quickly found that someone had convinced the Imperial Fleet that he was actually a wanted criminal, which led to a battle leaving his ship in urgent need of repairs. And while Goth and the Leewit, two of the notorious witches of Karres, could do amazing things, ship repair was not in their line. So he stopped at the next planet for repairs, but found that somehow his bank account had been cut off, and the authorities were looking for someone matching his description. There was only one thing to do-join the circus! An interstellar traveling circus, that is. All the galaxy loves a clown-as long as Pausert, Goth and the Leewit can keep their disguises from slipping. The show must go on-or the galaxy is doomed!</p><p>Mercedes Lackey, author of the best-selling Heralds of Valdemar and Bardic Voices series, is one of the top stars of fantasy. She was one of the first writers to have an online group devoted to her writings, and her novels routinely soar to the top of the genre best seller lists.. Other than writing she can be found at various times prying the talons of the birds of prey she is attempting to nurse back to health out of her hands, endangering her vision by creating various forms of Art Beadwork, and cross-stitching dragons, gryphons, and other semi-mythological fauna. <br>Eric Flint is a popular new star of military and alternate history SF. His first novel for Baen, Mother of Demons, was chosen by Science Fiction Chronicle as a best novel of the year. His second novel, 1632, a major novel of alternate history adventure, was both a commercial and critical success. His collaborations include 1633, a sequel to 1632, with David Weber, and five novels in the Belisarius series with David Drake, the latest being The Tide of Victory.

He lives in Southern Zululand, South Africa with his wife Barbara , two sons and a large number of Old English Sheepdogs.Adult/High School&#x2013;James H. Schmitz's <i>The Witches of Karres</i>, a far-future space opera combining screwball comedy with psi powers, has remained one of science fiction/fantasy's best-loved classics since its first publication in the 1960s. Decades of readers have been disappointed that Schmitz himself never revisited his richly imagined universe, but now there's a sequel that should satisfy all but the most nit-picking fans. <i>Wizard</i> seamlessly picks up the story where <i>Witches</i>ended, sending the still overly honest Captain Pausert and his oddly assorted crew of spies and precocious child-witches on a new mission to save humanity (and friends) from imminent disaster. Soon they are pursued by competing Empire factions, pirates, and alien gremlins, all with agendas of their own. Much of the time, the gang hides in plain sight&#x2013;in an intergalactic traveling showboat/circus, working as sideshow artistes and Shakespearian thespians (the Bard would have been delighted with these productions of his plays). Though the plot might seem at first to be hurtling randomly from crisis to crisis, soon the elements come together in a wacky Karres sort of way that matches Schmitz's narrative style and high standard of humor, imagination, and absurdity.To bring new readers up to speed, numerous references to the first book are skillfully worked into the narrative; for those already familiar with Karres, <i>Wizard</i>expands satisfyingly upon many elements of that universe that Schmitz merely touched upon. Fans of humorous science fiction will enjoy this outing.<i>&#x2013;Christine C.

Appearing in Agatha Christie&#39;s very first novel in 1920 and her very last in 1975, Hercule Poirot became the most celebrated detective since Sherlock Holmes, appearing in 33 novels, a play, and these 51 short stories. Arranged in their original publication order, these short stories provide a feast for hardened Agatha Christie addicts as well as those who have grown to love the detective through his many film and television appearances. This new edition now also includes Poirot and the Regatta Mystery, an early version of an Agatha Christie story not published since 1936!</p><p>Agatha Christie was born in Torquay in 1890 and became, quite simply, the best-selling novelist in history. Her first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, written towards the end of the First World War, introduced us to Hercule Poirot, who was to become the most popular detective in crime fiction since Sherlock Holmes. She is known throughout the world as the Queen of Crime. Her books have sold over a billion copies in the English language and another billion in 100 foreign languages.

Roth's masterpiece takes place on the couch of a psychoanalyst, an appropriate jumping-off place for an insanely comical novel about the Jewish American experience. Roth has written several great books--<i>Goodbye, Columbus</i> and <i>When She Was Good</i> among them, but it is perhaps <i>Portnoy's Complaint</i> for which he is best known.Portnoy's Complaint <i>n. </i>[after Alexander Portnoy (1933-)] A disorder in which strongly-felt ethical and altruistic impulses are perpetually warring with extreme sexual longings, often of a perverse nature. Spievogel says: "Acts of exhibitionism, voyeurism, fetishism, auto-eroticism and oral coitus are plentiful; as a consequence of the patient's "morality," however, neither fantasy nor act issues in genuine sexual gratification, but rather in overriding feelings of shame and the dread of retribution, particularly in the form of castration." (Spielvogel, O. "The Puzzled Penis," <i>Internationale Zeitschrift fur Psychoanalyse</i>, Vol. XXIV p. 909.) It is believed by Spielvogel that many of the symptoms can be traced to the bonds obtaining in the mother-child relationship.</p><h2>New Testament Background: Selected Documents: Revised and Expanded Edition</h2><p>C.K.

The Roman Empire</p><p><b>Augustus and the Imperial Settlement</b></p><p>The roots of that Empire in which the Christian faith was born ran deep and in many directions, not only into the Roman Republic but also into the Macedonian Empire of Alexander, and the Greek city states. Eventually, the Empire was able to seek philosophical justification in the cosmopolitanism of developed Stoicism (see 73-81); but at first it needed no justification beyond its own achievements. A world weary of civil war with its attendant social and economic disturbance and distress was prepared to welcome the victor of Actium as a saviour -- after all, what more did the average man ask of his gods than the peace, security, and social welfare Augustus gave him? Of course, there were some malcontents. The senatorial families deplored changes which deprived them of the substance of power and placed it in the hands of one man, armed with an Ultimate, if generally veiled, authority over life and property. But to the majority the Senate mattered little, and the provinces knew that they were far better governed than ever they had been under the Republic.</p><p>The character, motives, and intentions of Augustus; the political basis of the imperial constitution; the varying relations between the Emperors and the Senate -- these all present historical problems of unusual depth and complexity. Here, at the risk of undue simplification, will be given only a few passages illustrating the work of Augustus and some of the succeeding Emperors.</p><p><b>1</b></p><p><b><i>Res Gestae Divi Augusti</i> 12f., 24-7, 3 4 f</b></p><p>Towards the close of his life, Augustus deposited with the Vestal Virgins four documents. One was his will, disposing of his personal property. Of the remaining three, one contained directions for the celebration of his funeral, another an account of the things he had done (rerum a se gestarum; Suetonius, Augustus 1 0 1), and the third a military and financial account of the state of the Empire. The brass tablets on which, pursuant to Augustus's instructions, the Res Gestae were engraved have not been found; but the greater part of the document has been recovered from a bilingual (GreekLatin) inscription in the temple of Rome and Augustus at Ancyra (the Monumentum Ancyranum), now supplemented by a Greek text found at Apollonia (in Pisidia) and a Latin found at Pisidian Antioch. There can be little doubt that the Res Gestae were compiled partly for the purposes of propaganda; but the substantial accuracy of the facts contained in them seems to fail only through a few small lapses of memory.</p><p>At the same time, by decree of the Senate, a portion of the praetors and tribunes of the plebs, together with the consul, Q. Lucretius, and other men of note, were sent as far as Campania to meet my arrival, an honour which up to this day has been decreed to none other but myself.</p><p>When in the consulship of Tiberius Nero and P. Quintilius I returned to Rome from Spain and Gaul after settling the affairs of those provinces with success, the Senate, to commemorate my return, ordered an altar to Pax Augusta to be consecrated in the CampusMartius, at which it decreed that the magistrates, priests, and Vestal Virgins should celebrate an anniversary sacrifice.</p><p>Whereas our ancestors have willed that the gateway of Janus Quirinus should be shut, whenever victorious peace is secured by sea and by land throughout the empire of the Roman people, andwhereas before my birth twice only in all is it on record that the gateway has been shut, three times under my principate has the Senate decreed that it should be shut....</p><p>After my victory I replaced in the temples of all the communities of the province of Asia the ornaments which my adversary in thewar had, after despoiling the temples, taken into his own possession.</p><p>Silver statues of myself, standing or on horseback or sitting in a chariot, were set up in the city to the number of about eighty, which I myself took down, and out of the money value I set up gifts of gold in the temple of Apollo in my own name and in the names of thosewho had honoured me with the statues. I conquered the pirates and gave peace to the seas. In that war I handed over to their masters for punishment nearly 30,000 slaves who had run away from their owners, and taken up arms against the republic.</p><p>The whole of Italy of its own free will took the oath of fidelity tome, and demanded me as its leader in the war of which Actium was the crowning victory. An oath was also taken to the same effect by the provinces of Gaul, Spain, Africa, Sicily, and Sardinia.</p><p>Among those who at that time served under my standards were more than seven hundred senators; out of that number, either beforethat date or afterwards, up to the day on which these records were written, eighty-three attained the consulship, and about one hundred and seventy were elected to priesthoods.</p><p>I extended the frontiers of all the provinces of the Roman people, which had as neighbours races not obedient to our empire.</p><p>I restored peace to all the provinces of Gaul and Spain and to Germany, to all that region washed by the Ocean from Gades to the mouth of the Elbe.</p><p>Peace too I caused to be established in the Alps from the region nearest to the Hadriatic as far as the Tuscan sea, while no tribe was wantonly attacked by war.</p><p>My fleet sailed along the Ocean from the mouth of the Rhine as far towards the east as the borders of the Cimbri, whither no Roman before that time had penetrated either by land or sea.

These books would be distributed through respectable channels and would inevitably find their way into the hands and households of well-meaning families, who would go to them for facts but instead find bizarre untruths. The books would look normal enough but would read as if written by people who should not have written them. Sadly, that day is upon us. The fourth book in the <i>HOW</i> series, <i>Cold Fusion,</i> is to be feared. Like its predecessors, <i>Giraffes? Giraffes!</i> and <i>Animals of the Ocean, Cold Fusion</i> must also be kept far from the young people in your life. This book reveals the secrets of cold fusion, one of the most controversial scientific pursuits that can be conducted in a bathtub.</p></p><p>Toph Eggers is a screenwriter and is working on a movie for paramount based on the Haggis-on-Whey characters.

But when his father-in-law dies suddenly, calling him back to Japan earlier than expected, Iyer begins to grapple with the question we all have to live with: how to hold on to the things we love, even though we know that we and they are dying. In a country whose calendar is marked with occasions honoring the dead, this question is more urgent than anywhere else. Iyer leads us through the year following his father-in-law's death, introducing us to the people who populate his days: his ailing mother-in-law, who often forgets that her husband has died; his absent brother-in-law, who severed ties with his family years ago but to whom Hiroko still writes letters; and the men and women in his ping-pong club, who, many years his senior, traverse their autumn years in different ways. And as the maple leaves begin to redden and the heat begins to soften, Iyer offers us a singular view of Japan, in the season that reminds us to take nothing for granted.</p><p>PICO IYER is the author of eight works of nonfiction and two novels. A writer for <i>Time </i>since 1982, he is a frequent contributor to <i>The New York Times, Harper's, The New York Review of Books,</i> the <i>Los Angeles Times,</i> the <i>Financial Times,</i> and many other magazines and newpapers on both sides of the Atlantic and Pacific. He splits his time between Nara, Japan, and the United States.<b>Excerpted from <i>Autumn Light</i></b><br><br>Now, as we head out into the sunshine&#x2014;the northern hills of Kyoto are a blaze of russet, burnt umber, orange, under late-autumn skies of depthless blue&#x2014;we&#x2019;re ushered into a backstage room of sorts, before an afternoon conversation between the Dalai Lama and a celebrated novelist. <br><br> There are only four of us in the space: the Dalai Lama, Hiroko and myself, and a Californian monk from the Dalai Lama&#x2019;s temple who&#x2019;s also in our small traveling party. <br><br> &#x201c;So,&#x201d; says the Tibetan, &#x201c;what is the point of art? What is the larger purpose?&#x201d; <br><br> Startled, I cite the Sixth Dalai Lama, famous for his poems and songs. <br><br> The Dalai Lama doesn&#x2019;t look very interested. <br><br> The monk mentions Milarepa, the mystic who composed poems in a cave. <br><br> The Dalai Lama looks dissatisfied. <br><br> In his way of thinking, looking closely at reality is the only thing that matters, not all the ways we make embroidered designs around it. <br><br> I recall the November day two years ago when all of us traveled up with him to a fishing village north of Tokyo laid waste by the tsunami of eight months earlier. A few miles out of the city of Sendai, we began passing along clean, modern roads lined by nothing but compacted trash, block-long rectangles of smashed cars and refuse. Telephone poles listed at forty-five-degree angles; a solitary chair sat in the open skeleton of what had once been a living room. Buses bobbed on the water beside us. When we pulled up at Ishinomaki&#x2014;hundreds had gathered along the road there, behind ropes, to greet the famous visitor&#x2014;it was to see nothing but a flattened landscape, which looked like pictures I&#x2019;d seen of Hiroshima after the atom bomb. More than three thousand had lost their lives in this village alone, many of them children; nineteen thou- sand had lost their homes. <br><br> The Dalai Lama stepped out of his car and strode without hesitation to the people, mostly women, who had assembled in the street to see him. Many were sobbing, or calling out, in limited English, &#x201c;Thank you, thank you.&#x201d; He held one person&#x2019;s head against his chest; he blessed another. He touched heads, shook hands, looked deep into one set of eyes, then another, asking, &#x201c;What do you feel? . . . Are you still sad?&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Please, be brave,&#x201d; he told them, as the women sobbed and others pushed forwards. &#x201c;Please, change your hearts. You cannot change what has happened. Please help everyone else, help others become okay.&#x201d; <br><br> The crowd fell quiet; some of its members nodded. <br><br> &#x201c;Too many people died,&#x201d; he went on. &#x201c;If you worry, it cannot help them. Please, work hard. That is the best offering you can make to the ones you lost. Rebuild your community as your country rebuilt itself after the war.&#x201d; <br><br> It&#x2019;s the kind of advice that anyone might give, perhaps, but when he turned around, to walk towards the temple that had survived, gravestones in the foreground tilted crazily over or knocked down entirely, I saw the Dalai Lama take off his glasses and wipe away a tear himself. <br><br> Suffering is the central fact of life, from his Buddhist viewpoint; it&#x2019;s what we do with it that defines our lives. <br><br> Now, as he gathers his robes o stage, peering down to see how the theater&#x2019;s sound system works, I think of how, when we went into the temple in Ishinomaki, it was to see the bones of the lost, tidily gathered and placed in brightly colored boxes by the altar, under framed photographs, maybe fifty of them in all; in every case, Hiroko explained, there was no survivor to claim the remains, as Japanese custom decrees. &#x201c;All lose parent,&#x201d; she told me of the five-year-old boys lined up cheerfully in uniform to shake the Dalai Lama&#x2019;s hand in the autumn sun. <br><br> After taking his place in front of the altar, the Dalai Lama began to speak, recalling the afternoon he had been told, at the age of twenty-three, that he had to leave his home, as well as his homeland, that very evening, if both of them were not to be destroyed. No time to say goodbye to his friends, no chance to take his small dog. Two days later, as he was crossing the Himalayas towards exile, a new life, he heard that many of his friends were dead. <br><br> At the end of today&#x2019;s session, we return with the Dalai Lama and his bodyguards and monks and secretaries to his hotel, hasten up in the elevator to the top floor and walk at high speed down the corridor with him to his room. His eyes are often red after a long day of events, but his pace never slackens. He&#x2019;s holding Hiroko&#x2019;s hand as he moves forwards; as in a physical expression of his teachings, he reflexively reaches for any set of hands to grasp between his own as he strides along. <br><br> Just before we arrive at his door, Hiroko says, &#x201c;Your Holiness, we must leave you now. But thank you for everything.&#x201d; <br><br> He&#x2019;s on his way to Tokyo next day; we have obligations at home. <br><br> &#x201c;Also,&#x201d; she says&#x2014;her voice falters just a little&#x2014;&#x201c;I want to tell you: my father passed away this year.&#x201d; <br><br> Instantly the fast-stepping monk stops. He looks at her directly, deep into her eyes. <br><br> &#x201c;When?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;This year.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;What cause?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;No cause. He was old. His body was tired.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> He steps forwards and holds her for a long, long time. <br><br> Then he steps back and looks searchingly at her. &#x201c;Remember: Only body gone. Spirit still there.

It is October 23, 2018, and they are expecting Maurice's estranged daughter, Dilly, to either arrive on a boat coming from Tangier or depart on one heading there. This nocturnal vigil will initiate an extraordinary journey back in time to excavate their shared history of violence, romance, mutual betrayals and serial exiles, rendered with the dark humor and the hardboiled Hibernian lyricism that have made Kevin Barry one of the most striking and admired fiction writers at work today.</p><p>KEVIN BARRY is the author of the novels <i>Beatlebone </i>and <i>City of Bohane</i> and the story collections <i>Dark Lies the Island </i>and <i>There Are Little Kingdoms</i>.

Shatkin, M.D., M.P.H.</b>, is one of the country's foremost voices in child and adolescent mental health.

He lives in New York City with his wife and two teenage children.<b>The Adolescent Paradox</b><br><br>Adolescents are stronger than they will ever be again in their lives. Theirimmune response is at its peak. They tolerate extremes of heat and coldbetter than those older and younger. They heal from physical injury more quickly. But their likelihood of getting sick increases greatly andtheir death rates rise enormously during the teen years, particularlyfor males. Whereas the mortality rate of girls triples between the ages of twelve and nineteen, for boys that rate increases more than six timesduring these same years. Beginning at age twelve, in fact, the death rate in boys increases at a rate of more than 30 percent per year, while the rate for females increases nearly 20 percent per year. And death rates continue to grow still higher as our teens reach their early twenties. This paradox of having greater physical ability yet greater vulnerability occurs because of the behaviors, emotions, and patterns of thinking in which adolescents and young adults engage. <br><br>There is no disputing that adolescents take outlandish risks. In theUnited States, accidents, suicide, and homicide are responsible for over 85 percent of the deaths among those aged fifteen to twenty-four. Suicideis the second leading cause and alone accounts for 20 percent of deaths in this age range, more than cancer, heart disease, congenital anomalies,&nbsp;stroke, flu and pneumonia, HIV, and chronic respiratory disease combined.<br><br>And what about crime? After the age of thirty, people rarely commit serious crimes. Violent crimes are predominantly committed by young people, and adults who violate the law were almost always teens who violated the law. As our population of young people grows, like after a baby boom, so does the amount of crime. As a public health educator, then medical student and resident in psychiatry, I was taught that adolescents engage in high-risk behavior because they believe they&#x2019;re invincible. Why else would they get into so many motor vehicle accidents, have so many unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections, and use alcohol, drugs, and cigarettes? Invincibility sure seems like a highly plausible theory. But as we now know, invincibility just doesn&#x2019;t hold up under scrutiny.<br><br>Despite our efforts at educating youth about the risks they face, explaining to them time and again that they are, in fact, vulnerable, we&#x2019;ve seen minimal to no change in the rates of binge drinking and drunk driving, condom use, obesity, bicycle and motorcycle helmet use, bullying, and so forth among teens over the past two decades. In fact, we&#x2019;ve seen an increase in suicide and marijuana use; and although cigarette use is down slightly&#x2014;likely due to the price of cigarettes, which has increased at twice the rate of inflation&#x2014;e-cigarette use has more than quadrupled in the past four years.<br><br>What other factors besides invincibility might be at play? Maybe adolescents are irrational and lack good decision-making capacity or they seek strong emotions and new sensations. Maybe at times. But we now know that the causes of risky behavior go far beyond that. Adolescents are engineered for risk-taking behavior, and everything from their brains to&nbsp;their hormones to their peer relationships works to encourage and maintain a high-risk approach to just about everything.<br><br>Shakespeare had it right. Teens and young adults get into a whole lot of mischief and engage in some pretty risky behaviors. Curiously, they even think that the chance of getting hurt from these behaviors is higher than it really is. So why would they put themselves in harm&#x2019;s way by taking dangerous risks like having unprotected sex if they believe that the chances of &#x201c;getting wenches with child&#x201d; or HIV transmission are so high? They clearly don&#x2019;t think they&#x2019;re invincible, as repeated experiments have shown. Something else must be going on.<br><br>This book is about that something else. What lies within the pages that follow will challenge everything you think you know about why tweens, teens, and young adults make decisions every day that result in pregnancy, addiction, accidental injury, and death. The factors that matter are hidden deep within our brains and evolutionary history and are strongly influenced by our peer relationships and life experiences.The science is there, and this book is your escort. Once you understand what influences adolescents to make risky decisions, you will know why much of what we do to try to protect kids isn&#x2019;t working. You&#x2019;ll also have a much better idea of what we should be doing to help keep them safe.</p><h2>My Song: A Memoir</h2><p>Harry Belafonte is not just one of the greatest entertainers of our time; he has led one of the great American lives of the last century. Now, this extraordinary icon tells us the story of that life, giving us its full breadth, letting us share in the struggles, the tragedies, and, most of all, the inspiring triumphs.<br> &nbsp;<br> Belafonte grew up, poverty-ridden, in Harlem and Jamaica. His mother was a complex woman&#x2014;caring but withdrawn, eternally angry and rarely satisfied. His father was distant and physically abusive. It was not an easy life, but it instilled in young Harry the hard-nosed toughness of the city and the resilient spirit of the Caribbean lifestyle. It also gave him the drive to make good and channel his anger into actions that were positive and life-affirming. His journey led to the U.S. Navy during World War II, where he encountered an onslaught of racism but also fell in love with the woman he eventually married. After the war he moved back to Harlem, where he drifted between odd jobs until he saw his first stage play&#x2014;and found the life he wanted to lead. Theater opened up a whole new world, one that was artistic and political and made him realize that not only did he have a need to express himself, he had a lot to express.<br> &nbsp;<br> He began as an actor&#x2014;and has always thought of himself as such&#x2014;but was quickly spotted in a musical, began a tentative nightclub career, and soon was on a meteoric rise to become one of the world&#x2019;s most popular singers. Belafonte was never content to simply be an entertainer, however. Even at enormous personal cost, he could not shy away from activism. At first it was a question of personal dignity: breaking down racial barriers that had never been broken before, achieving an enduring popularity with both white and black audiences. Then his activism broadened to a lifelong, passionate involvement at the heart of the civil rights movement and countless other political and social causes. The sections on the rise of the civil rights movement are perhaps the most moving in the book: his close friendship with Martin Luther King, Jr.; his role as a conduit between Dr. King and the Kennedys; his up-close involvement with the demonstrations and awareness of the hatred and potential violence around him; his devastation at Dr. King&#x2019;s death and his continuing fight for what he believes is right.<br> &nbsp;<br> But <i>My Song</i> is far more than the history of a movement. It is a very personal look at the people in that movement and the world in which Belafonte has long moved. He has befriended many beloved and important figures in both entertainment and politics&#x2014;Paul Robeson, Eleanor Roosevelt, Sidney Poitier, John F. Kennedy, Marlon Brando, Robert Kennedy, Nelson Mandela, Fidel Castro, Tony Bennett, Bill Clinton&#x2014;and writes about them with the same exceptional candor with which he reveals himself on every page. This is a book that pulls no punches, and turns both a loving and critical eye on our country&#x2019;s cultural past.<br> &nbsp;<br> As both an artist and an activist, Belafonte has touched countless lives. With <i>My Song,</i> he has found yet another way to entertain and inspire us. It is an electrifying memoir from a remarkable man.</p><p>Harry Belafonte&#x2019;s 1956 album <i>Calypso</i> made him the first artist in history to sell more than one million LPs. He has won both a Tony Award and an Emmy, and he was awarded the National Medal of Arts by President Clinton. He has served as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador and is the recipient of Kennedy Center Honors for excellence in the performing arts. He currently resides in New York City with his wife, Pamela.<br> &nbsp;<br> Michael Shnayerson, a longtime contributing editor to <i>Vanity Fair</i>, is the author of <i>Irwin Shaw;</i> <i>The Car That Could;</i> <i>The Killers Within,</i> coauthored with Mark J. Plotkin, and <i>Coal River,</i> which recounted the efforts of Appalachian lawyers and grassroots groups&nbsp;to stop the devastating practice of mountaintop coal removal in southern West Virginia. Shnayerson&#x2019;s passion for those environmental activists was one reason Harry Belafonte chose him to collaborate on his autobiography. Shnayerson lives in Bridgehampton, New York, with his daughter, Jenna.1<br><br>The phone rang late in the evening in my New York apartment. It was the night of August 4, 1964. A night of grief and anger for all of us in the civil rights movement, but especially those in Mississippi. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got a crisis on our hands down here,&#x201d; the young man on the line said. &#x201c;We need help.&#x201d;<br><br>At the start of that fateful summer, hundreds of volunteers, most of them students, many of them white, all of them knowing how dangerous the work would be, had come down from northern universities to register black voters and support rural blacks in pursuit of their civil rights. They were fanning out along the front lines of a civil rights war, unarmed in a state of seething segregationists.<br><br>Mississippi&#x2019;s police stood ready at the slightest pretext to beat them bloody and throw them in jail. The Ku Klux Klan might well do worse. That day, we all learned just how much worse. The bodies of three volunteers, missing since June 21, had been found in a shallow grave near Philadelphia, Mississippi. Michael Schwerner, James Chaney, and Andrew Goodman&#x2014; two of them white, one black&#x2014; had been arrested on an alleged traffic violation, briefl y jailed, then allowed to drive off, after dark, into a KKK ambush. All three had been beaten, then shot. Chaney, the black volunteer, had been tortured and mutilated.<br><br>I&#x2019;d helped raise a lot of the money to launch Mississippi Freedom Summer. I&#x2019;d called all the top entertainers I knew&#x2014; Frank Sinatra, Lena Horne, Henry Fonda, Marlon Brando, Joan Baez, the Kingston Trio, Dick Gregory, and more&#x2014; to ask that they give money directly or participate in benefit concerts. That money bought a lot of gas and cars, housing and food. But now more was needed. A lot more.<br><br>The original plan had called for students to do two-week shifts, then go home and be replaced by others. With the ominous disappearance of Schwerner, Chaney, and Goodman, every shift had insisted on staying.<br><br>Now that the bodies had been found, all those volunteers voted to stay not just through summer, but into the fall as well. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s good they&#x2019;re staying,&#x201d; explained Jim Forman, the young man who called me that night. Jim was the de facto head of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), one of several civil rights groups down there. &#x201c;Because if they leave now, or even at the end of August, the Klan will say it intimidated them into going, and the press will play it that way. And if they all stay, we can get thousands of more voters registered. The problem is we don&#x2019;t have the resources to keep them all here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What do you need?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;At least fifty thousand dollars.&#x201d;<br><br>I told him I&#x2019;d get it, one way or the other. &#x201c;How soon do you need it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to burn through the rest of our budget in seventy-two hours.&#x201d;<br><br>Before he rang off, Forman told me one other thing. &#x201c;This could get really ugly,&#x201d; he said quietly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m hearing a lot of people say enough is enough, the hell with nonviolence. They&#x2019;re taking up guns. I&#x2019;m worried they&#x2019;re going to take matters into their own hands.&#x201d;<br>I had to think hard about where that money might come from, and how I might get it to Greenwood, Mississippi. I could tap my own savings for the whole $50,000&#x2014; I&#x2019;d written a check to SNCC for an amount not much smaller than that in its early days to help establish it, and others since then. For me it was &#x201c;anything goes,&#x201d; but I owed it to my family to keep us fi nancially safe. Paul Robeson, the extraordinary actor, singer, and activist whose path I&#x2019;d tried to follow my whole adult life, had given so much money to social causes that he&#x2019;d left himself vulnerable to his enemies, chief among them the federal government, a formidable force led by J. Edgar Hoover and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, when he was blacklisted as a communist in the late 1940s. With Senator Joseph McCarthy riding shotgun, the federal government had cowed Carnegie Hall and other American venues into not hiring him, then seized his passport so that he couldn&#x2019;t earn a living performing abroad. Eventually Paul ran through his savings and slid into a deep place of sadness. I never forgot that. Somehow, I&#x2019;d have to raise most of this money from others. In two days, maybe three. Then there was the matter of how that money would get to Mississippi. I couldn&#x2019;t just wire it and have a black civil rights activist go to the local Western Union offi ce to ask for his $50,000, please. He&#x2019;d be dead before he drove a mile away. So would a white college volunteer. As for banks, those fi ne institutions owned and operated by Mississippi&#x2019;s white power elite? No way.<br><br>The money would have to be brought down in cash. And unless I could come up with some brighter idea, I&#x2019;d have to take it down myself.<br><br>My wife, Julie, started pulling together a New York fundraiser at our West End Avenue apartment. I fl ew to Chicago. Irv Kupcinet, as powerful a columnist in his city as Walter Winchell was in New York, gathered dozens of guests at his home on a day or two&#x2019;s notice. White guests, bearing checkbooks. Why did I, as a black performer, have such sway with Irv and his friends? Our friendship traced back to my clubcircuit days as a young troubadour in the early fi fties, but our personal history was just one part of it. Without quite knowing how I did it, I had some power to reach a hand across the racial divide. That, I knew, had as much to do with the moment as with me. Galvanized by the shocking news of the volunteers&#x2019; murders, Irv&#x2019;s guests thrust cash and checks at me&#x2014; $35,000 worth&#x2014; as if I was the personal emissary of the civil rights movement. Which in a way, in that place and on that<br>evening, I was. After making a trip to Montreal, I had another $20,000.<br><br>When I got back to New York, Julie and I took in $15,000 more from our own apartment fundraiser. Time was running out: I&#x2019;d hoped to raise $100,000, but $70,000 would have to do. I felt pretty good about that sum of money. I felt even better now that I had a sidekick for the trip: my pal from our days together as struggling actors in Harlem, Sidney Poitier.<br><br>Sidney and I were like brothers. Born within eight days of each other, we shared the same West Indian heritage, and the same burning desire to break out of grinding poverty. Incredibly, both of us had achieved our dreams as entertainers. Sidney was the top black actor in Hollywood. I&#x2019;d found my first successes as a singer, but had gone on to my own share of Broadway and Hollywood triumphs. We were, to put it simply, the two top black male entertainers in the world. Like<br><br>brothers, we were also fiercely competitive, and had our differences, both political and personal. For starters, Sidney was a lot more cautious than I was. &#x201c;What kind of protection are you going to have?&#x201d; he asked warily when I asked him to come.<br><br>&#x201c;I talked to Bobby about it,&#x201d; I said. Robert F. Kennedy was still serving, after his brother&#x2019;s assassination, as U.S. Attorney General under President Johnson. He&#x2019;d directed me to Burke Marshall, head of the Justice Department&#x2019;s civil rights division. Both understood the risk I was taking. In Mississippi&#x2019;s vicious climate, the chances of a Klansman taking a potshot at me were actually pretty high. Knocking off that rich Negro singer from New York who thought he knew what was best for the South? Ten points! Marshall heard me out on the phone, and took down my itinerary. I conveyed all this to Sidney, maybe presuming a bit more from my conversation with Marshall than I should have. &#x201c;Marshall&#x2019;s on it,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;That means federal security every step of the way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Every step of the way,&#x201d; Sidney echoed.<br><br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Besides, it&#x2019;ll be harder for them to knock off two black stars than one. Strength in numbers, man.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Sidney said grimly. &#x201c;But after this, Harry?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Never call me again.&#x201d;<br><br>I knew Sidney well enough to know he meant it&#x2014; at least at that moment. Of course I chose to view his fury as a joke and laughed it off, but I laughed alone. Unaccompanied, and not making much conversation, the two of us boarded a plane in Newark, New Jersey, bound for Jackson, Mississippi. I&#x2019;d deposited the fundraiser checks and replaced them with cash, so we had $70,000 in small bills stuffed into a black doctor&#x2019;s bag. In that long- ago time, no one asked us what we were carrying. A flight attendant just waved us aboard.<br><br>Our flight to Jackson was the evening&#x2019;s last one into the main airport. We found Jim Forman and two other SNCC volunteers waiting<br>for us, but otherwise the terminal sat virtually deserted. The only sign of local authority we saw was a black maintenance man pushing a broom. Sidney shot me an angry glance. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s our federal security?&#x201d; &#x201c;Probably an FBI agent in disguise,&#x201d; I told him. Sidney didn&#x2019;t so much as chuckle.<br><br>The volunteers led us out into the heavy, humid Mississippi night and over to a private strip beside the airport where a little Cessna was waiting. The pilot, who was white, greeted us most soberly, with a deep southern accent. As we piled in, I stole another look at him. Was he a Klansman, leading us into a trap? He sure seemed to fit the role.<br><br>My fears deepened as the tiny plane fl ew toward Greenwood. It was a bumpy ride. The pilot seemed unconcerned. We took every pitch of the plane as the beginning of the end.<br><br>Finally we landed on a dirt runway beside a shack that constituted Greenwood&#x2019;s airport. The pilot taxied past it, and then back, let us out, and took off immediately. What did he know that we didn&#x2019;t? I looked around, struck as much by the darkness as by the heat. I&#x2019;d never seen a night as black as this. A poem called &#x201c;The Creation,&#x201d; by James Weldon Johnson, came back to me.<br><br><i>. . . far as the eye of God could see<br>Darkness covered everything,<br>Blacker than a hundred midnights<br>Down in a cypress swamp.</i><br><br>Two more SNCC volunteers were waiting for us, with two cars, to take us into town. Sidney and I slid into the back of one, with Jim Forman in the passenger seat and a young SNCCer named Willie Blue in the driver&#x2019;s seat; the rest got into the second car. Both cars had been sanded to a dull fi nish so they wouldn&#x2019;t shine at night. A good precaution, but not good enough: As Willie and the other driver started their engines, a long row of headlights flashed on at the far end of the dark airfield. &#x201c;That must be the federal agents,&#x201d; I said to Sidney. But we could see that the pairs of headlights were at different heights, and they blazed with differing degrees of brightness. Willie Blue dashed my hopes. &#x201c;Agents, my ass,&#x201d; he muttered. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the Klan.&#x201d;<br><br>Instead of driving away from the row of headlights, in the direction of the main road to town, Willie and the other driver started moving at full speed toward them. We got close enough to see the dim outlines of three or four old pickup trucks. Then, as if at some prearranged signal, Willie and the other driver veered off to the side, taking a rough, alternative route to the road that led to town. The pickups fell in line behind us.<br><br>&#x201c;Why aren&#x2019;t you driving faster?&#x201d; I shouted. Willie was keeping right to the forty-mile-an-hour speed limit. &#x201c;Faster, man!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Willie shouted back. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s exactly what they want us to do.<br><br>They got a state trooper up there waiting in his car with the headlights off, ready to arrest us for speeding. He takes us to the station, lets us out in an hour, and even more of the Klan be waiting for us. That&#x2019;s how they work. That&#x2019;s how those boys got killed.&#x201d;<br>From behind us, the fi rst pickup truck sped up and started to pass us. Through the rear window, we could see it had a two-by- four across its grille&#x2014; a makeshift battering ram&#x2014; and no license plate. Willie swerved into the middle of the two- lane road to keep the pickup from pulling alongside. Now the pickup started ramming the back of our car. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t let him pull up beside us,&#x201d; Willie shouted. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll shoot.&#x201d;<br><br>Willie switched on his walkie-talkie and radioed the SNCC office in Greenwood. From the other walkie- talkie I heard a crackling voice: &#x201c;We&#x2019;re on our way.&#x201d;<br><br>The pickup truck kept ramming our car, but Willie stayed doggedly to the center of the road, edging left every time the truck tried to pull up. Finally, after two or three terrifying minutes that seemed like forever, I looked down the road to see a convoy of cars coming toward us from Greenwood. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s them,&#x201d; Willie said. The SNCC brigade to the rescue. My heart was still pounding, but I started to breathe again.<br><br>As the convoy approached, the pickup trucks slowed, and their headlights retreated. That was when we heard the shots, a dozen or more. Whether the Klansmen were fi ring at us or shooting up in the air, we couldn&#x2019;t tell. No one was hit, and no bullets pierced our cars. When we turned off the main road, secure now among the SNCC fleet, we looked back to see the pickups rolling off down the main road, with more gunfire as they went.<br><br>The convoy led us into Greenwood, and beyond, to an Elks hall, where hundreds of volunteers were gathered. They had spent the day in heated debate, tense and tired, over what their next moves should be. Most of their options depended on us. When Sidney and I walked in, screams of joy went up from the crowd. Sidney and I had heard a lot of applause in our day, but never anything like those cheers. After weeks of lonely, scary fieldwork, these volunteers were wrung out and in despair. To have two of the biggest black stars in the world walk in to show solidarity with them&#x2014; that meant a lot to them, and to us.<br><br>The crowd took up a freedom song, and then another&#x2014; the spirituals that had given these brave volunteers comfort and encouragement day after day. Finally Sidney spoke. &#x201c;I am thirty- seven years old,&#x201d; he told the crowd. &#x201c;I have been a lonely man all my life . . . because I have not found love . . . but this room is overflowing with it.&#x201d; Then Sidney turned to me. I let a pause fall over the room, then sang out, &#x201c;<i>Day- o</i> . . .&#x201d; The crowd picked it up with a roar. The &#x201c;Banana Boat Song&#x201d; was my musical signature, but more than that, it was a cry from the heart of poor workers, a cry of weariness mingled with hope, both<br>of which those volunteers felt profoundly that night. &#x201c;<i>Day- o, Day- o</i> /<i> Daylight come an&#x2019; me wan&#x2019; go home&#x201d;</i> had also been turned into a civil rights anthem&#x2014; &#x201c;Freedom, freedom, freedom come an&#x2019; it won&#x2019;t be long.&#x201d; When the crowd had sung both versions, I held up the black satchel I&#x2019;d brought, upturned it on the table in front of me, and let the bundles of cash cascade out, to delirious shouts.<br><br>As Sidney had said, we felt a lot of love in that barn. Outside it, though, Ku Klux Klanners sat in idling cars; we could hardly keep them out of Greenwood. That day planes had fl own overhead, dropping KKK leaflets that urged Mississippians not to let the niggers steal their rights. Late that night, after a dinner of chicken and spareribs, Sidney and I were escorted to the house where we were to sleep, with armed guards patrolling outside. Our bedroom had one double bed&#x2014; not too big a double bed, either&#x2014; shoved up against a wall under a window. Sidney blanched.<br><br>&#x201c;Look, I&#x2019;ll take the inside, okay?&#x201d; I told him, meaning the side by the wall. I meant it as a concession: I&#x2019;d be the one scrunched in by my snoring bedmate.<br><br>Sidney gave me a suspicious look. &#x201c;Yeah, but if someone sticks a gun through that window and shoots, I&#x2019;ll be more apt to get hit.&#x201d;<br><br>He was only half joking.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, okay, I&#x2019;ll take the outside,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>Sidney thought about that. If I was willing to take the outside, maybe it was the better side after all. &#x201c;No, I&#x2019;ll take the outside,&#x201d; he<br>said. &#x201c;If you do get shot, I&#x2019;d hate to have to climb over your dead ass to get to the door.&#x201d;<br><br>In bed with the li...</p><h2>Chez Panisse Cooking: A Cookbook</h2><p>"Extraordinary," "poetic," and "inspired" are only a few words that have been used to describe the food at Chez Panisse. Since the first meal served there in 1971, Alice Waters's Berkeley, California, restaurant has revolutionized American cooking, earning its place among the truly great restaurants of the world. Renowned for the brilliant innovations of its ever-changing menu, Chez Panisse has also come to represent a culinary philosophy inspired by nature -- dedicated to the common interest of environment and consumer in the use of gloriously fresh organic ingredients.<br><br>In Chez Panisse Cooking, chef Paul Bertolli -- one of the most talented chefs ever to work with Alice Waters -- presents the Chez Panisse kitchen's explorations and reexaminations of earlier triumphs. Expanding upon -- and sometimes simplifying -- the concepts that have made Chez Panisse legendary, Bertolli provides reflections, recipes, and menus that lead the cook to a critical and intuitive understanding of food itself, of its purest organic sources and most sublime uses. Perhaps best described by Richard Olney, "Paul Bertolli's cuisine is what 'health food' should be and never is: a celebration of purity. The food is imaginative but never complicated; it is art."<br><br>Enhanced by Gail Skoff's breathtaking hand-colored photographs, Paul Bertolli's recipes remind us of the simple and passionate joys in cooking and of the inspiration to be drawn from each season's freshest foods: glistening local salmon creates a wildly colorful springtime carpaccio or is grilled later in the season with tomatoes and basil vinaigrette; autumn's fresh white truffles are sliced into an extraordinarily textured salad of pastel hues with fennel, mushrooms, and Parmesan cheese; figs left on the tree until they grow heavy and sweet appear in a fall fruit salad with warm goat cheese and herb toast. Season by season, Chez Panisse Cooking will captivate the senses and imagination of the cook with such entrancing recipes as Sugar Snap Peas with Brown Butter and Sage; Buckwheat Cakes with Smoked Salmon, Creme Fraiche, and Capers; Grilled Fish Wrapped in Fig Leaves with Red Wine Sauce; Lamb Salad with Garden Lettuces, Straw Potatoes, and Garlic Sauce; Marinated Veal Chops Grilled over an Oak Fire; or Seckel Pears Poached in Red Wine with Burnt Caramel. Here, some of the restaurant's most remarkable recent menus for special occasions are recreated, from a White Truffle Dinner to the Chez Panisse Tenth Annual Garlic Festival, to a supper for poet Vikram Seth that began. with "The Season's song, a summer ballad/Tomatoes, basil, flowers, beans/In unison dance, Lobster Salad..."<br><br>Many of these recipes reflect Paul Bertolli's love of northern Italian food; for other dishes, the inspiration is French; in all, there is a keen awareness of the abundance of uncompromisingly pure, seasonal ingredients to be found in America.<br><br>Above all, the Chez Panisse recipes are meant to inspire the cook to create his or her own version; to awaken the senses to the nuances of taste, texture, and color in cooking; to "discover the ecstatic moments when the intuition, skill, and accumulated experience of the cook merge with the taste and composition of the food." Since its original publication in 1988, this classic cookbook has proved to be indispensable to the shelf of every serious cook and every serious cookbook reader.</p><p>Alice Waters's Chez Panisse restaurant in Berkeley, California, sparked a movement toward simple, elegant cooking using fresh, seasonal, regional ingredients. In <i>Chez Panisse Cooking,</i> Chef Paul Bertolli collaborates with Waters to adapt many of the restaurant's trademark recipes for home cooking. Look here for fresh, innovative salads, soothing soups, and delightful desserts. Waters's fondness for exotic vegetables and greens may have you searching a little harder in the grocery store, but the results will make your efforts worthwhile."It is one of the few books that I have seen for some time that makes me want to get in the kitchen. I especially like the menus, and how and why Paul Bertolli makes them as he does. I also like his artful use of information about how to cook ... the section called 'Boiling-Water Bath' is a little masterpiece. And so are every one of the deviations from straight recipes. In other words, the book is the kind that could quickly become essential. It is written with great authority and yet with a touch that is both light and realistic. I wish I'd done it myself."<p>-- M. F. K. Fisher</p><p>"The recipes in this book ... are magnificently toothsome and smack invitingly of California at its best."</p><p>-- Craig Clairborne</p><p>"What a wonderful book ... full of country wisdom, market savy and a real passion for savory eating."</p><p>Gael Greene</p><p>Paul Bertolli's cuisine is what 'health food' should be and never is: a celebration of purity. The food is imaginative but never complicated; it is art."</p><p>-- Richard Olney</p></p><h2>In Memory&#39;s Kitchen : A Legacy from the Women of Terezin</h2><p>A beautiful memorial to the brave women who defied Hitler by preserving a part of their hertiage and a part of themselves in this handwritten collection of recipes, proving that the Nazis could not break the spirit of the Jewish people.</p><p>Of all the documents of the Holocaust, this cookbook compiled from memory by the female prisoners at Terezin, a way station to Auschwitz, may be the most remarkable. The Terezin prisoners recalled and wrote down their recipes for chocolate torte, breast of goose, plum strudel, and other traditional dishes not because they thought they might ever need them--they were surviving on scraps and potato peels at the time--but as a testament to the future, so that their grandchildren might receive a fragment of their inheritance. The manuscript found its way in 1969 to Anny Stern, the daughter of Mina Pachter, whose poems on barracks life are also included.The sheets of paper are as brittle as fallen leaves; the faltering handwriting changes from page to page; the words, a faded brown, are almost indecipherable. The page are filled with recipes. Each is a memory, a fantasy, a hope for the future. Written by undernourished and starving women in the Czechoslovakian ghetto/concentration camp of Terezin (also known as Theresienstadt), the recipes give instructions for making beloved dishes in the rich, robust Czech tradition. Sometimes steps or ingredients are missing, the gaps a painful illustration of the condition and situation in which the authors lived. Reprinting the contents of the original hand-sewn copybook, In Memory&#39;s Kitchen: A Legacy from the Women of Terezin is a beautiful memorial to the brave women who defied Hitler by preserving a part of their heritage and a part of themselves. Despite the harsh conditions in the Nazis&#39; &#34;model&#34; ghetto - which in reality was a way station to Auschwitz and other death camps - cultural, intellectual, and artistic life did exist within the walls of the ghetto. Like the heart-breaking book ... I never saw another butterfly ... which contains the poetry and drawings of the children of Terezin, the handwritten cookbook is proof that the Nazis could not break the spirit of the Jewish people.</p><h2>Become the Arrow (On Target Series)</h2><p>Learn about the modern bare bow aiming and shooting system called Become the Arrow developed by Byron Ferguson.

Carl von Clausewitz, a Prussian soldier, had witnessed at first hand the immense destructive power of the French Revolutionary armies which swept across Europe between 1792 and 1815. His response was to write a comprehensive text covering every aspect of warfare. On War is both a philosophical and practical work in which Clausewitz defines the essential nature of war, debates the qualities of the great commander, assesses the relative strengths of defensive and offensive warfare, and - in highly controversial passages - considers the relationship between war and politics. His arguments are illustrated with vivid examples drawn from the campaigns of Frederick the Great and Napoleon Bonaparte. For the student of society as well as the military historian, On War remains a compelling and indispensable source.</p><p><p><strong>Carl Von Clausewitz </strong>(1780-1831) was a Prussian soldier and German military theorist who stressed the moral and political aspects of war.</p></p><h2>Measure for Measure (Signet Classics)</h2><p>A timeless tale from the immortal Bard--revised and repackaged!</p><p>John Dover Wilson&#39;s New Shakespeare, published between 1921 and 1966, became the classic Cambridge edition of Shakespeare&#39;s plays and poems until the 1980s.

But for a few, the horrors will come, skipping, to fetch them off to the highway of the damned ...</p><p>Gathered together for the first time in one volume, here are fifteen mind-shattering stories from the awesome imagination of World Fantasy Award winning author Clive Barker. They will take you to the brink - and beyond ...</p></p><p>"Everybody is a book of blood; wherever we're opened, we're red." For those who only know Clive Barker through his long multigenre novels, this one-volume edition of the <i>Books of Blood</i> is a welcome chance to acquire the 16 remarkable horror short stories with which he kicked off his career. For those who already know these tales, the poignant introduction is a window on the creator's mind. Reflecting back after 14 years, Barker writes:<p> </p><blockquote> I look at these pieces and I don't think the man who wrote them is alive in me anymore.... We are all our own graveyards I believe; we squat amongst the tombs of the people we were. If we're healthy, every day is a celebration, a Day of the Dead, in which we give thanks for the lives that we lived; and if we are neurotic we brood and mourn and wish that the past was still present.<p> Reading these stories over, I feel a little of both. Some of the simple energies that made these words flow through my pen--that made the phrases felicitous and the ideas sing--have gone. I lost their maker a long time ago. </p></blockquote><p> These enthusiastic tales are not ashamed of visceral horror, of blood splashing freely across the page: "The Midnight Meat Train," a grisly subway tale that surprises you with one twist after another; "The Yattering and Jack," about a hilarious demon who possesses a Christmas turkey; "In the Hills, the Cities," an unusual example of an original horror premise; "Dread," a harrowing non-supernatural tale about being forced to realize your worst nightmare; "Jacqueline Ess: Her Will and Testament," about a woman who kills men with her mind. Some of the tales are more successful than others, but all are distinguished by strikingly beautiful images of evil and destruction. No horror library is complete without them. <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p>Clive Barker was born in Liverpool in 1952.

Its mantras of black economic empowerment, land ownership, and self-help inspired generations of black leaders, including Marcus Garvey, Elijah Muhammad, Malcolm X, and Louis Farrakhan. In rags-to-riches fashion, Washington recounts his ascendance from early life as a mulatto slave in Virginia to a 34-year term as president of the influential, agriculturally based Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. From that position, Washington reigned as the most important leader of his people, with slogans like "cast down your buckets," which emphasized vocational merit rather than the academic and political excellence championed by his contemporary rival W.E.B. Du Bois. Though many considered him too accommodating to segregationists, Washington, as he said in his historic "Atlanta Compromise" speech of 1895, believed that "political agitation alone would not save [the Negro]," and that "property, industry, skill, intelligence, and character" would prove necessary to black Americans' success. The potency of his philosophies are alive today in the nationalist and conservative camps that compose the complex quilt of black American society.This book is in Electronic Paperback Format.

Both the valley and the coast would serve as settings for some of his best fiction. In 1919 he went to Stanford University, where he intermittently enrolled in literature and writing courses until he left in 1925 without taking a degree. During the next five years he supported himself as a laborer and journalist in New York City, all the time working on his first novel,&nbsp;<i>Cup of Gold</i>&nbsp;(1929).<br> &nbsp;<br> After marriage and a move to Pacific Grove, he published two California books,&nbsp;<i>The Pastures of Heaven</i>&nbsp;(1932) and&nbsp;<i>To a God Unknown</i>&nbsp;(1933), and worked on short stories later collected in&nbsp;<i>The Long Valley</i>&nbsp;(1938). Popular success and financial security came only with&nbsp;<i>Tortilla Flat</i>&nbsp;(1935), stories about Monterey&#x2019;s paisanos. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly.

The incompatible demands of the separate states threatened its existence; some states were even in danger of turning into the kind of tyranny they had so recently deposed. A truly national government was needed, one that could raise money, regulate commerce, and defend the states against foreign threats&#x2013;without becoming as overbearing as England. So thirty-six-year-old James Madison believed. That summer, the Virginian was instrumental in organizing the Constitutional Convention, in which one of the world&#x2019;s greatest documents would be debated, created, and signed. Inspired by a sense of history in the making, he kept the most extensive notes of any attendee.Now two esteemed scholars have made these minutes accessible to everyone. Presented with modern punctuation and spelling, judicious cuts, and helpful notes&#x2013;plus fascinating background information on every delegate and an overview of the tumultuous times&#x2013;here is the great drama of how the Constitution came to be, from the opening statements to the final votes.

He is the author of numerous books and articles.Tuesday, May 29. [in convention] On May 29, the aristocratic thirty-five-year-old governor of Virginia, Edmund Randolph, took the floor to attack the Articles of Confederation and introduce a series of resolutions for a new Constitution. The mandate of the Convention was only to revise and amend the Articles, but Randolph&#x2019;s resolutions, known collectively as the Virginia Plan (see Appendix A), would scrap them and substitute a strong national government with final authority over what had been semi- independent states. The government would consist of a national legislature, judiciary, and executive&#x2014;each with the ability to check the others&#x2019; power. The legislature would have two houses, or &#x201c;branches,&#x201d; with the larger one (the &#x201c;first branch&#x201d;) elected by the people and the smaller one (the &#x201c;second branch&#x201d;) elected by the larger one. The national legislature could veto state laws it deemed to violate the national Constitution, and it would choose the chief executive, who could veto the legislature&#x2019;s laws with the aid of a Council of Revision. Mr. Randolph then opened the main business. . . . He expressed his regret that it should fall to him, rather than those who were of longer standing in life and political experience, to open the great subject of their mission. But as the Convention had originated from Virginia and his colleagues supposed that some proposition was expected from them, they had imposed this task on him. He then commented on the difficulty of the crisis and the necessity of preventing the fulfilment of the prophecies of the American downfall. He observed that in revising the federal system we ought to inquire (1) into the properties which such a government ought to possess; (2) the defects of the confederation; (3) the danger of our situation; and (4) the remedy. The character of such a government ought to secure (1) against foreign invasion; (2) against dissensions between members of the Union or seditions in particular states; (3) to procure to the several states various blessings of which an isolated situation was incapable; (4) to be able to defend itself against encroachment; and (5) to be paramount to the state constitutions. In speaking of the defects of the confederation he professed a high respect for its authors and considered them as having done all that patriots could do in the then-infancy of the science of constitutions and of confederacies. . . . He then proceeded to enumerate the [confederation&#x2019;s] defects: (1) that the confederation produced no security against foreign invasion, Congress not being permitted to prevent a war nor to support it by their own authority. Of this, he cited many examples. . . . (2) that the federal government could not check the quarrels between states nor a rebellion in any, not having constitutional power nor means to interpose according to the exigency. (3) that there were many advantages which the United States might acquire, which were not attainable under the confederation&#x2014;such as a productive impost [i.e., a tax on imports]&#x2014;counteraction of the commercial regulations of other nations&#x2014;pushing of commerce ad libitum [at pleasure]&#x2014;etc., etc. (4) that the federal government could not defend itself against the encroachments from the states. (5) that it was not even paramount to the state constitutions ratified, as it was, in many of the states. He next reviewed the danger of our situation, appealed to the sense of the best friends of the United States, the prospect of anarchy from the laxity of government everywhere, and to other considerations. He then proceeded to the remedy, the basis of which, he said, must be the republican principle. . . . [After formally offering fifteen enumerated propositions or resolutions comprising the Virginia Plan,] he concluded with an exhortation not to suffer the present opportunity of establishing general peace, harmony, happiness, and liberty in the United States to pass away unimproved.* It was then resolved &#x201c;that the house will tomorrow resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole House to consider of the state of the Ameri- *Another of the note takers at the Convention, Robert Yates, recorded that Randolph concluded his remarks by stating that he intended &#x201c;a strong consolidated union, in which the idea of states should be nearly annihilated.&#x201d; can Union,&#x201d; and that the propositions moved by Mr. Randolph be referred to the said committee. . . . Wednesday, May 30. [in committee of the whole] The delegates, when meeting in Convention, were bound to follow established rules of parliamentary procedure and decision-making much like those that still govern formal legislative assemblies in the United States. To facilitate their deliberations on the Virginia Plan, the delegates decided to sit initially as a committee composed of all the members (or &#x201c;Committee of the Whole&#x201d;) rather than in Convention. Legislative committees typically utilize procedures that permit freer discussion and more flexible decision-making than those imposed on full legislative bodies, and this is true for committees of the whole as well as smaller committees. Like the recommendation of any committee, however, recommendations of a committee of the whole must still go before the formal legislative body for final consideration and approval. Utilizing this procedure for the proposed Constitution gave delegates the opportunity to consider each element of it at least twice&#x2014;once in the Committee of the Whole and then in Convention&#x2014;and allowed for them to experiment with new ideas, especially at the committee stage. Both in the Committee of the Whole and in Convention, state delegations voted by majority rule as a single unit either for or against a proposition, with one vote per state. If the delegates from a state split evenly on a proposition, that state&#x2019;s vote would be &#x201c;divided.&#x201d; On this day Gouverneur Morris explained the difference between a federal government, as the term was then understood, and the national government that he and his allies wished to create. The Convention proceeded to vote that the United States needed a national government, which the Articles of Confederation did not provide. With that decision, the Convention committed itself to plunging into the uncharted waters of designing a viable large-scale republic. The propositions of Mr. Randolph which had been referred to the committee being taken up. . . . It was agreed on motion of Mr. Butler, seconded by Mr. Randolph, to pass on to the third [&#x201c;That a national government ought to be established consisting of a supreme legislative, executive, and judiciary&#x201d;], which underwent a discussion, less however on its general merits than on the force and extent of the particular terms &#x201c;national&#x201d; and &#x201c;supreme.&#x201d; Mr. Pinckney wished to know of Mr. Randolph whether he meant to abolish the state governments altogether. Mr. Randolph replied that he meant by these general propositions merely to introduce the particular ones which explained the outlines of the system he had in view. Mr. Butler said he had not made up his mind on the subject and was open to the light which discussion might throw on it. After some general observations, he concluded with saying that he had opposed the grant of powers to [the Confederation] Congress heretofore because the whole power was vested in one body. The proposed distribution of the powers into two different bodies changed the case and would induce him to go great lengths. Gen. Pinckney expressed a doubt whether the act of [the Confederation] Congress recommending the Convention, or the commissions of the deputies to it, could authorize a discussion of a system founded on different principles from the federal constitution. Mr. Gerry seemed to entertain the same doubt. Mr. G. Morris explained the distinction between a federal and national, supreme government, the former being a mere compact resting on the good faith of the parties, the latter having a complete and compulsive operation. He contended that in all communities there must be one supreme power, and one only. Mr. Mason observed that the present confederation was not only deficient in not providing for coercion and punishment against delinquent states, but argued very cogently that punishment could not in the nature of things be executed on the states collectively, and therefore that such a government was necessary as could directly operate on individuals and would punish those only whose guilt required it. Mr. Sherman, who took his seat today, admitted that the confederation had not given sufficient power to Congress and that additional powers were necessary, particularly that of raising money, which, he said, would involve many other powers. He admitted also that the general and particular jurisdictions ought in no case to be concurrent. He seemed, however, not [to] be disposed to make too great inroads on the existing system, intimating as one reason that it would be wrong to lose every amendment by inserting such as would not be agreed to by the states. . . . On the question as moved by Mr. Butler . . . it was resolved in Committee of the Whole that a national government ought to be established, consisting of a supreme legislative, executive, and judiciary: Mass., Pa., Del., Va., N.C., S.C., aye 6; Conn., no 1; N.Y., divided [meaning that the voting delegates from the state were evenly split so that the state&#x2019;s vote did not count]. . . . Thursday, May 31. [in committee of the whole] Following the vote on Wednesday, May 30, to draft a national government, delegates started discussing the details of the Virginia Plan. Another Georgia delegate arrived on this day, allowing the Georgia delegation to vote and bringing the total number of states represented to ten. The delegates easily agreed that the national legislature should have two branches. The first major controversial issue was deciding how to elect members to what the Virginia Plan termed &#x201c;the first branch,&#x201d; which would become the House of Representatives. A number of delegates doubted that the people themselves could be trusted to elect members of Congress, while others insisted that it was critical that the people do so. More Americans were voting than had done so before. A number of states had lowered property requirements for the franchise, and only South Carolina still had a religious test. Up to 80 percent of adult white males could vote; similarly qualified free black males could vote in a few states; and women could vote in New Jersey. Resolution 4, first clause, &#x201c;that the members of the first branch of the national legislature ought to be elected by the people of the several states,&#x201d; being taken up. Mr. Sherman opposed the election by the people, insisting that it ought to be by the state legislatures. The people, he said, immediately should have as little to do as may be about the government. They lack information and are constantly liable to be misled. Mr. Gerry. The evils we experience flow from the excess of democracy. The people do not [lack] virtue, but are the dupes of pretended patriots. In Massachusetts, it had been fully confirmed by experience that they are daily misled into the most baneful measures and opinions by the false reports circulated by designing men, and which no one on the spot can refute. One principal evil arises from the want of due provision for those employed in the administration of government. It would seem to be a maxim of democracy to starve the public servants. He mentioned the popular clamor in Massachusetts for the reduction of salaries and the attack made on that of the governor, though secured by the spirit of the constitution itself. He had, he said, been too republican heretofore; he was still, however, republican, but had been taught by experience the danger of the leveling spirit. Mr. Mason argued strongly for an election of the larger branch by the people. It was to be the grand depository of the democratic principle of the government. It was, so to speak, to be our House of Commons. It ought to know and sympathize with every part of the community; and ought therefore to be taken not only from different parts of the whole republic, but also from different districts of the larger members of it, which had in several instances, particularly in Virginia, different interests and views arising from difference of produce, of habits, etc., etc. He admitted that we had been too democratic but was afraid we should incautiously run into the opposite extreme. . . . Mr. Wilson contended strenuously for drawing the most numerous branch of the legislature immediately from the people. . . . No government could long subsist without the confidence of the people. In a republican government, this confidence was peculiarly essential. He also thought it wrong to increase the weight of the state legislatures by making them the electors of the national legislature. . . . On examination it would be found that the opposition of states to federal measures had proceeded much more from the officers of the states than from the people at large. Mr. Madison considered the popular election of one branch of the national legislature as essential to every plan of free government. . . . He thought, too, that the great fabric to be raised would be more stable and durable if it should rest on the solid foundation of the people themselves than if it should stand merely on the pillars of the legislatures. Mr. Gerry did not like the election by the people. . . . Experience, he said, had shown that the state legislatures drawn immediately from the people did not always possess their confidence. He had no objection, however, to an election by the people if it were so qualified that men of honor and character might not be unwilling to be joined in the appointments. He seemed to think the people might nominate a certain number out of which the state legislatures should be bound to choose. Mr. Butler thought an election by the people an impracticable mode. On the question for an election of the first branch of the national legislature by the people: Mass., N.Y., Pa., Va., N.C., Ga., aye 6; N.J., S.C., no 2; Conn., Del., divided. . . .</p><h2>This Language, A River: A History of English</h2><p><p><em>This Language, A River</em> is an introduction to the history of English that recognizes multiple varieties of the language in both current and historical contexts. Developed over years of undergraduate teaching, the book helps students both to grasp traditional histories of English and to extend and complicate those histories. </p> <p>Exercises throughout provide opportunities for puzzling out concepts, committing terms and data to memory, and applying ideas. A comprehensive glossary and up-to-date bibliographies help to guide further study. </p></p><p><p><strong>K. Aaron Smith and Susan M. Kim</strong> are Professors of English at Illinois State University. </p><p>&#x201c;<em>This Language, A River</em> is an excellent resource for the evolving History of the English Language class, which must cover grammar fundamentals and linguistics in addition to the history of English. By combining lucid explanation with concrete examples and exercises, K. Aaron Smith and Susan M. Kim have written a text that helps students navigate language change through orthography, phonology, morphology, and syntax. This approach empowers students to play with language, encouraging them to make connections between grammar and semantics, prescriptive media and imaginative literature, and cultural invention and orthography. And by dedicating a majority of their text to pre-modern Englishes, Smith and Kim help students explore these connections in the &#x2018;strange&#x2019; and &#x2018;unfamiliar&#x2019; roots of our language.&#x201d; &#x2015; Sarah Breckenridge Wright, Duquesne University </p> <p>&#x201c;This textbook confronts head-on the problems implicit in teaching the history of English to students, many of whom have not yet met linguistics or a millennium of history of either the language or its speakers. Straightforward prose, exercises interspersed strategically (with answers at the end), definitions of new terms when they first occur (as well as in an alphabetical listing at the end), a sampling of &#x2018;minor Englishes&#x2019;&#x2015;altogether a well-balanced introduction to English and its history. The authors&#x2019; &#x2018;pleasure ... in the ways in which [their subject] brings together so many different kinds of intellectual work&#x2019; is apparent from beginning to end.&#x201d; &#x2015; Robert Stevick, Professor Emeritus, University of Washington </p> <p>&#x201c;K. Aaron Smith and Susan Kim have given us an HEL textbook for the 21st century in <em>This Language, A River</em>. Uncompromising in their dedication to linguistic rigor, the authors never lose sight of the needs of contemporary students as they fully explain and define key terms and concepts for the study of language. At the same time, they deftly interweave the internal and external histories of English to create a coherent diachronic narrative that details political, literary, cultural, and social aspects of language change. Students of literature will appreciate the authors&#x2019; use of canonical texts to illustrate points of linguistic and cultural interest along the way, while exercises throughout each chapter offer opportunities for in-class activities or homework. In all, <em>This Language, A River</em> should serve today&#x2019;s HEL students and teachers well for years to come.&#x201d; &#x2015; Michael Matto, Adelphi University </p></p><h2>Learning &amp; Behavior: Eighth Edition</h2><p><p>This book reviews how people and animals learn and how their behaviors are changed as a result of learning.

Hardly oppressed like women and minorities, business corporations, too, have fought since the nation&#x2019;s earliest days to gain equal rights under the Constitution&#x2015;and today have nearly all the same rights as ordinary people.</p><p>Exposing the historical origins of <em>Citizens United</em> and <em>Hobby Lobby</em>, Adam Winkler explains how those controversial Supreme Court decisions extending free speech and religious liberty to corporations were the capstone of a centuries-long struggle over corporate personhood and constitutional protections for business. Beginning his account in the colonial era, Winkler reveals the profound influence corporations had on the birth of democracy and on the shape of the Constitution itself. Once the Constitution was ratified, corporations quickly sought to gain the rights it guaranteed. The first Supreme Court case on the rights of corporations was decided in 1809, a half-century before the first comparable cases on the rights of African Americans or women. Ever since, corporations have waged a persistent and remarkably fruitful campaign to win an ever-greater share of individual rights.</p><p>Although corporations never marched on Washington, they employed many of the same strategies of more familiar civil rights struggles: civil disobedience, test cases, and novel legal claims made in a purposeful effort to reshape the law. Indeed, corporations have often been unheralded innovators in constitutional law, and several of the individual rights Americans hold most dear were first secured in lawsuits brought by businesses.</p><p>Winkler enlivens his narrative with a flair for storytelling and a colorful cast of characters: among others, Daniel Webster, America&#x2019;s greatest advocate, who argued some of the earliest corporate rights cases on behalf of his business clients; Roger Taney, the reviled Chief Justice, who surprisingly fought to limit protections for corporations&#x2015;in part to protect slavery; and Roscoe Conkling, a renowned politician who deceived the Supreme Court in a brazen effort to win for corporations the rights added to the Constitution for the freed slaves. Alexander Hamilton, Teddy Roosevelt, Huey Long, Ralph Nader, Louis Brandeis, and even Thurgood Marshall all played starring roles in the story of the corporate rights movement.</p><p>In this heated political age, nothing can be timelier than Winkler&#x2019;s <em>tour de force</em>, which shows how America&#x2019;s most powerful corporations won our most fundamental rights and turned the Constitution into a weapon to impede the regulation of big business.</p> 50 illustrations</p><p><strong>Adam Winkler</strong> is a professor at UCLA School of Law, where he specializes in American constitutional law.

Warner&#x2014;prominent in his day as a writer and newspaper editor&#x2014;was a dedicated amateur gardener who shared with Mark Twain, his close friend and neighbor, a sense of humor that remains deliciously fresh today. <br><br>In monthly dispatches, Warner chronicles his travails in the garden, where he and his cat, Calvin, seek to ward off a stream of interlopers, from the neighbors&#x2019; huge-hoofed cows and thieving children, to the reviled, though &#x201c;propagatious,&#x201d; pusley weed. To read Warner is to join him on his rounds of his beloved vegetable patch, to feel the sun on his sore back, the hoe in his blistered hands, and yet, like him, never to lose sight of &#x201c;the philosophical implications of contact with the earth, and companionship with gently growing things.&#x201d; <br><br>This Modern Library edition is published with an extensive new Introduction by Allan Gurganus, author of <i>Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All</i> and <i>The Practical Heart</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;Warner&#x2019;s book might have been written last week.

Her early-twentieth-century writings continue to inspire writers and activists today. This collection includes selections from both her fiction and nonfiction work. <br><br>In addition to the title story, there are seven short stories collected here that combine humor, anger, and startling vision to suggest how women's "place" in society should be changed to benefit all. The nonfiction selections are from Gilman's <i>The Man-Made World: Our Androcentric Culture</i> and her masterpiece, <i>Women And Economics</i>, which was translated into seven languages and established her international reputation as a theorist. <br><br>Also included in a delightful excerpt from Gilman's utopian novel,<b> </b><i>Herland</i>, an acidly funny tale about three American male explorers who stumble into an all-female society and begin their odyssey by insisting, "This is a civilized country . . . there must be men." Gilman's analyses of economic and women's issues are as incisive and relevant today as they were upon their original publication. This volume is an unprecedented opportunity to rediscover a powerful American writer.</p><p>"The most original and challenging mind which the [women's] movement produced."<br>--Carrie Chapman CattCharlotte Perkins Gilman, feminist, author, critic, and theorist, was born on July 3 1860, in Hartford, Connecticut. In 1884 she married Charles Walter Stetson, gave birth to a daughter the following year, and was subsequently overcome by bouts of depression, which nearly caused her complete breakdown. Finally she fled to California and created a scandal by obtaining a divorce and granting custody of her daughter to her husband. In 1892 her story "The Yellow Wallpaper" appeared, and she began her writing and social activism in earnest.

Part mystery, part war story, part romance." --Anthony Doerr, author of <i>All the Light We Cannot See</i></b><b><i><br></i></b>Vienna, 1914. Lucius is a twenty-two-year-old medical student when World War I explodes across Europe. Enraptured by romantic tales of battlefield surgery, he enlists, expecting a position at a well-organized field hospital. But when he arrives, at a commandeered church tucked away high in a remote valley of the Carpathian Mountains, he finds a freezing outpost ravaged by typhus. The other doctors have fled, and only a single, mysterious nurse named Sister Margarete remains.<br>But Lucius has never lifted a surgeon's scalpel. And as the war rages across the winter landscape, he finds himself falling in love with the woman from whom he must learn a brutal, makeshift medicine. Then one day, an unconscious soldier is brought in from the snow, his uniform stuffed with strange drawings. He seems beyond rescue, until Lucius makes a fateful decision that will change the lives of doctor, patient, and nurse forever.<br>From the gilded ballrooms of Imperial Vienna to the frozen forests of the Eastern Front; from hardscrabble operating rooms to battlefields thundering with Cossack cavalry, <i>The Winter Soldier </i>is the story of war and medicine, of family, of finding love in the sweeping tides of history, and finally, of the mistakes we make, and the precious opportunities to atone.</p><p>Daniel Mason is a physician and author of the novels <i>The Piano Tuner </i>and <i>A Far Country</i>.

He lives in the Bay Area with his family."The beauty of <i>The Winter Soldier </i>persists even through scenes of unspeakable agony. That tension reflects the span of Daniel Mason's talent. As a writer, he knows how to capture the grace of a moment; as a doctor, he knows how wrong things can go...<i>The Winter Soldier</i> draws us into the deadly undertow of history that swept away so many in the early twentieth century. The redemption the story ultimately offers is equally unlikely and gorgeous, painfully limited but gratefully received in a world thrown into chaos."&#x2015;<b><i>Ron Charles, <i>Washington Post</i></i></b><br><br>"Not only does Mason make every crumb of pertinent history, culture, and geography so real throughout this saga that a reader feels instantly teleported into all of it but <i>The Winter Soldier</i> delivers, in shocking detail, a relentless inventory of the era's medical knowledge and practices...The novel's pacing clips along tightly; its closure, when at last it comes, proves deeply, memorably moving...One is reminded of a dozen greats: <i>Doctor Zhivago, The English Patient, For Whom the Bell Tolls</i>."&#x2015;<b><i>Joan Frank, <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></i></b><br><br>"<i>The Winter Soldier </i>held me by the throat from the first lyrical page to the last.

We don&#x2019;t have time for this.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> August 1989 and I was six years old, hiding behind the yellowed living room curtains in our crappy, run-down apartment while Mom, Eunice, and Mom&#x2019;s business partner, Sally White, argued about my clothing choice for the evening. We were already running late for Vandergriff High School&#x2019;s production of <i>The Sound of Music, </i>but I wanted to wear a costume: a cheap, flimsy mask and cape knockoff produced to cash in on that summer&#x2019;s Batman film. I&#x2019;d been wearing it nonstop in the week since Sally bought it for me.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was paying only vague attention to the conversation. The living room curtains hung before the sliding glass door to our apartment&#x2019;s little atrium, and I&#x2019;d turned to look out at it. Every unit in our complex had a ten-by-twelve space, open to the elements up top and closed in on three sides by walls of the unit (in our case, it was my bedroom window on one side, the blank wall bordering my mother&#x2019;s bathroom opposite, and catercorner to both, the sliding glass door to the living room), with a fourth wall separating your atrium from your next-door neighbor&#x2019;s. Think of it like the poor person&#x2019;s version of the back porch or balcony, a patch of sky to call your own but no view of your neigh�borhood, or even a parking lot. A more generous soul might try to talk up the privacy such an atrium provided, but in my own experience, it was hard to ever feel anything but incarcerated on that little spread of cracked concrete. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Noah, I can see your sneakers,&#x201d; Mom said. &#x201c;Come out now or you&#x2019;ll have to stay home and miss the play.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I shuffled back into full view. Mom, Eunice, and Sally stood in the middle of the stained beige carpet, Mom with her arms crossed, Eunice wearing a backpack, Sally hiding a smile behind one hand.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Take it off,&#x201d; Mom said again.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Eunice gets to bring her backpack,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Eunice is bringing homework.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Everyone in the play is wearing costumes,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Off, now.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I untied the knotted string around my neck and pulled the mask off my head. The whole thing slumped to the floor behind me.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Your hair is a fright,&#x201d; Mom said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Margaret,&#x201d; Sally said. &#x201c;No one is going to care if he looks a little tousled.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mom pinched the bridge of her nose. &#x201c;Fine. Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>2</b><br> &nbsp;<br> The high school parking lot was a study in chaos by the time we arrived, and Mom had to park far from the entrance, carefully guiding her wheezing old Ford Torino among clumps of slow-moving people. She glowered and huffed as she dragged me across the parking lot, and I had to run to keep my footing. The high school looked gargantuan and sophisticated compared to my elementary building, and I mar�veled at the endless trophy cases and lockers as we hurried toward the auditorium, with its plush folding seats and midnight blue stage curtain. We found four seats together near the stage.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t take your mom&#x2019;s mood personally, kiddo,&#x201d; Sally said, leaning close as we settled in. &#x201c;We had a rough day at the store.&#x201d; She was referring to Bump in the Night, the comic book/memorabilia shop they&#x2019;d opened in 1984, using the proceeds from the sale of my late father&#x2019;s extensive horror collection. If Mom&#x2019;s moods were any indica�tion, every day was a rough day at the store.<br> &nbsp;<br> On my other side, Eunice had already unpacked her bag. She scowled at the open textbook on her lap and scratched numbers into a spiral notebook.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What are you working on?&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Algebra,&#x201d; she said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Is it hard?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Only when people interrupt me.&#x201d; She winked to show there were no hard feelings.<br> &nbsp;<br> An excited hush fell over the crowd as the auditorium dimmed. Bells began to ring in the orchestra pit, and a chorus of female voices rose from my left and right. Two lines of nuns floated down the aisles, candles in hand, singing a solemn, beautiful song whose words I couldn&#x2019;t make out. Their voices drifted over us, lovely and haunt�ing. As they reached the bottom of the auditorium, they mounted the stage, faced the audience, and broke into a joyful chant of &#x201c;Hallelujah.&#x201d; They filed off into the wings as their voices faded, leaving the stage empty and dark.<br> &nbsp;<br> A moment later, a spotlight crept up, revealing a single figure before a painted backdrop. She wore a simple postulant&#x2019;s dress and held a wooden bucket with both hands. Sydney, age seventeen, as Maria. Unlike Julie Andrews&#x2019;s chaste, motherly Maria, Sydney had left her hair long and brown, tied back in a ponytail, and despite the loose, baggy dress, she glowed in the bright light as she began to sing:<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>My day in the hills has come to an end, I know.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A star has come out to tell me it&#x2019;s time to go.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> The orchestra strings rose to meet and accompany her as she spun slowly across the stage and let the song unreel. It wasn&#x2019;t a Julie Andrews or Mary Martin impression, but something uniquely Sydney: wounded, wondering, and raw, something private made public. I clamped my hands over my mouth and tears tickled my knuckles as they rolled past. I didn&#x2019;t want to make a sound and break this delicate spell.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; Eunice whispered. She dropped something into my lap. I reached down and felt the cheap, slippery fabric. My bat cape and cowl. I bunched it in my hands, fingered the slight points of the floppy bat ears. It was still agony to watch Sydney sing, but something loosened in my chest. It became endurable.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>3</b><br> &nbsp;<br> The cast received a standing ovation during curtain call, but the auditorium went nuts when Sydney emerged and led the final bow. Afterward, families hung around the auditorium to wait for their respective cast and crew members, and also to talk to the show&#x2019;s direc�tor, Mr. Ransom. By 1989, seven years after he and his wife had moved in next door to my family&#x2019;s old house and he&#x2019;d helped my father run the Tomb, Daniel Ransom had rounded out and his dark hair had thinned, but he still had a deep, authoritative voice and a quick laugh, and when he smiled at me, I always felt like I was personally putting light into the world.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Look at that ham,&#x201d; Mom grumbled, watching him beam as he accepted congratulations, his laughter echoing in the auditorium.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Keep your distance and don&#x2019;t make eye contact,&#x201d; Sally said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Here he comes anyway. Daniel,&#x201d; Mom said, shaking his hand.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It was a wonderful show,&#x201d; Sally said.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mr. Ransom waved the compliment off, bashful and pleased with himself at the same time. &#x201c;Did Sydney tell you the opening with the nuns in the aisles was her idea?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not surprised, if that&#x2019;s what you mean,&#x201d; Mom said.<br> &nbsp;<br> His smile calcified, turned false. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s a special kid.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They&#x2019;re all special, right?&#x201d; Mom said. &#x201c;At least, come fund-raiser time.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The smile slipped. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not asking for money, Margaret. I just think a lot of your daughter.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll let her know you said so,&#x201d; Mom said. She opened her purse and began digging around inside.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;While we&#x2019;re on the subject, though,&#x201d; he said, either missing or ignoring the obvious dismissal, <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Halloween is right around the corner. Have you given any more thought to my proposal?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You already have my answer,&#x201d; Mom said.<br> &nbsp;<br> I winced as Mr. Ransom tossed off a tiny salute. &#x201c;Always a pleasure, Margaret. Sally, Eunice, Noah,&#x201d; he said, nodding to each of us. He retreated into a crowd of admirers.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You know he&#x2019;s having a rough time,&#x201d; Sally said.<br> &nbsp;<br> She was referring to the collapse of his marriage, which we all knew about but talked around, using phrases like <i>rough time </i>or <i>troubles</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mom rolled her eyes at Mr. Ransom&#x2019;s back. &#x201c;Boo hoo.&#x201d; She glanced at me and scowled at the cape clenched in my hands. &#x201c;Where did you get that?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>4</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Sydney went to dinner with some friends after the play, coming out only to get our congratulations and announce her plans before she disappeared backstage again. Mom complained about the wasted time, but there wasn&#x2019;t much gas left in her fury tank. She was tired.<br> &nbsp;<br> When we arrived back at the apartment, Sally kissed us all on the cheek and left, and Mom bid us good night and disappeared into her own room, leaving me and Eunice alone in the living room.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a school night, mister,&#x201d; Eunice said, dropping a hand on my shoulder. &#x201c;And way past your bedtime. Go brush your teeth and put on pajamas.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Will you read to me?&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;For a little bit, but only if you hurry,&#x201d; she said.<br> &nbsp;<br> I did as ordered, and, after hanging my cape in the closet, I climbed into bed. When Eunice came into my room a little later with a paper�back in one hand, she had to do a bit of a dance to get to my bed, crossing the minefield of scattered toys and dirty laundry on the balls of her feet, and even after she reached the bed and urged me to scoot over, she had to pull spaceships and action figures from beneath the blankets to make enough space for herself.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How can you sleep with so much junk in here?&#x201d; she said, setting a Ghostbuster on my nightstand.<br> &nbsp;<br> I always had trouble drifting off at night, and because I wasn&#x2019;t as smart as Eunice had been at my age, I played rather than read or wrote myself to sleep. I scooted against the wall to make room. She settled in next to me and pushed her glasses up her nose, her bony, freckled arm cold against mine. She opened her copy of <i>The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath </i>and began to read:<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>There presently rose ahead the jagged hills of a leprous-looking coast, and Carter saw the thick unpleasant grey towers of a city. The way they leaned and bent, the manner in which they were clustered, and the fact that they had no windows at all, was very disturbing to the prisoner; and he bitterly mourned the folly which had made him sip the curious wine of that merchant with the humped turban. As the coast drew nearer, and the hideous stench of that city grew stronger, he saw upon the jagged hills many forests, some of whose trees he recognised as akin to that solitary moon-tree in the enchanted wood of earth, from whose sap the small brown zoogs ferment</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> We&#x2019;d been reading <i>Kadath </i>for a few nights now. I had trouble fol�lowing the story, with its skimpy characterization and preponderance of goofy words like <i>zoogs, </i>but I liked listening to Eunice&#x2019;s voice. Her slow, careful way of speaking, the way she seemed to handle each word like a delicate, precise thing, always soothed me. I&#x2019;d already started to nod off against Eunice&#x2019;s shoulder when she shut the book for the night and got up to tuck me in.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Who do I love most?&#x201d; she said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Me,&#x201d; I said, waking up a little.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And who do you love most?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;<br> She kissed my forehead. &#x201c;Sleep tight, little prince.&#x201d; She turned on my night-light, switched off the overhead light, and made to leave the room.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Eunice,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;<br> She paused.<br> &nbsp;<br> I worked my mouth for a moment, struggling for words. I wanted to communicate my fear, my need for her to stay close, but I was also afraid that if I said anything, she might decide that the Lovecraft was too intense for a bedtime story, and stop reading it to me.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Good night.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Night.&#x201d; She shut the door behind her.<br> &nbsp;<br> The scratching began as soon as the door closed, a quick, insistent scrabbling against the glass of my bedroom window. It had been hap�pening for weeks now, and I&#x2019;d safety-pinned the curtains together so no one could see inside, even though the window only looked out on our apartment&#x2019;s closed, private atrium. A small sliver of space remained visible between the panels, and through it I saw only darkness.<br> &nbsp;<br> The scratching grew in intensity, a panicked, screechy song. I wished I&#x2019;d hidden my Batman cape under my pillow instead of hanging it in the closet. With my cape, I could feel brave, and safe, but to get to it now I would have to cross in front of the window. Instead I stuffed my head under my pillow and waited for the sound to stop. It seemed to go on for hours.</p><h2>In His Face: A Prophetic Call to Renewed Focus</h2><p>This is an intense book that calls the reader back to the centrality of a moment-by-moment walk with Jesus.&nbsp; If you have asked God to lift you to a higher spiritual plane, this book is for you.

Nesbit&#39;s classic story of how Gerald, Cathy and Jimmy find an enchanted garden and awake a princess from a hundred-year sleep, only to have her immediately made invisible by a magic ring. Her rescue is difficult, funny and sometimes frightening.</p><p>A plot summary makes this story sound ordinary by children's literature standards: the summer adventures of four children who discover an enchanted castle and a magic ring. But Edith Nesbit's adored classic (written in 1907) is so much more than the description suggests. Right from the start, the author plays with the idea of magic, teasing us with a sleeping princess who turns out to be a fake. Elsewhere, the magic is "real" as can be--in fact, though written nearly 100 years ago, <i>The Enchanted Castle</i> prefigures the magical realism of modern novels in the matter-of-fact way it weaves the uncanny into the children's everyday life. And, while few authors are confident enough to parody bad writing, Nesbit does it hilariously (and ever so gently) through one character's tendency to "talk like a book": "'To brush his hair and his clothes... was to our hero but the work of a moment,' said Gerald." Things turn scary when the Ugly Wuglies, fake people made from painted cardboard masks, old clothes, and broomsticks, come to life. But on the whole this book about enchantment--much praised by such luminaries as H.G. Wells and Noel Coward--is, simply, enchanting. (Ages 6 and older) <i>--Richard Farr</i>EDITH NESBIT was a mischievous child who grew up into an unconventional adult. With her husband, Hubert Bland, she was one of the founder members of the socialist Fabian Society; their household became a centre of the socialist and literary circles of the times. E. Nesbit turned late to children&#39;s writing. Her first children&#39;s book, THE TREASURE SEEKERS, was published in 1899 to great acclaim. Other books featuring the Bastable children followed, and a series of magical fantasy books, including FIVE CHILDREN AND IT also became very popular. THE RAILWAY CHILDREN was first published monthly in the LONDON MAGAZINE in 1905, and published as a book in 1906 and has been in print ever since.</p><h2>Principles of War (Dover Military History, Weapons, Armor)</h2><p>"Not simply the greatest but the only truly great book on war," declared historian Bernard Brodie of <i>Principles of War.</i> Written two centuries ago by a Prussian military thinker, this is the most frequently cited, the most controversial, and in many ways, the most modern book on warfare. Author Carl von Clausewitz fought against the armies of the French Revolution and Napoleon, served as a high-ranking staff officer, and became a prominent military educator. By his day, war had become a contest of mass armies, with results decided by swift, concentrated action and superior effort. "Victory is purchased by blood," Clausewitz proclaims, stating that total victory is assured only through annihilation of the enemy's forces. Based on the author's "thought and observation, philosophy and experience," <i>Principles of War </i>examines the moral and psychological aspects of warfare, stressing the necessity of such qualities as courage, audacity, and self-sacrifice and the importance of morale and public opinion. Clausewitz emphasizes the notion of strategy as an evolving plan, rather than a formula, a concept that makes this work adaptable to modern strategists in fields beyond military science. Translated into virtually every major language, <i>Principles of War</i> is required reading in intermediate-level and senior military schools, as well as in many civilian strategic studies programs and business schools.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German&#34;Not simply the greatest but the only truly great book on war.&#34;</p><h2>The Best American Short Stories 2013</h2><p>&#x201c;As our vision becomes more global, our storytelling is stretching in many ways.

She was the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of numerous novels, including <i>Sullivan's Island</i>, <i>Plantation</i>, <i>Pawleys Island</i>, <i>Shem Creek</i>, and <i>Isle of Palms</i>.A Postcard From Linda <p></p><p>Can I just tell you why I am so deliriously happy to drive all through the night from New Jersey to South Carolina? Here we are, boxed in between this wall of eighteen wheelers on our left and right, in front and behind, in this little pocket of flying road, racing down I-95 at seventy-six miles an hour. My daughters are asleep beside me and in the backseat. I don&#x2019;t care that it&#x2019;s pouring rain. I don&#x2019;t care that it&#x2019;s dark. On another night, I would be terrified out of my skin by the blasting of horns. But not tonight. Let me tell you something. These trucks are like huge guardian angels rushing us to safety and the rain is washing us clean. Life has been a little rough around the edges and it was time to break out. Yeah. A little rough would be one way of understating it.</p><p>Oh, eventually you&#x2019;ll hear the whole story, because this is a long ride and there ain&#x2019;t much to do besides tell secrets and think about life. Thinking about life is what I had been doing for one very long time. I finally decided to quit the thinking nonsense and do something. I mean, I was even driving myself crazy from my own whining. Then I came to this conclusion. You don&#x2019;t like your life? Go get another one and shut the heck up already, right?</p><p>Look, I know I&#x2019;m not the only single parent in the world. And I know I&#x2019;m not the only one who&#x2019;s tight for money all the time, okay? And, I might not be the biggest gambler you ever met, but I know when it&#x2019;s time to change the scenery and if you don&#x2019;t do it when you feel the urge, you might be blowing off the last life raft that ever floats your way. It&#x2019;s probably worth noting that I waited to change the scenery until I went digging for my mascara in Gracie&#x2019;s makeup bag (my fifteen year-old daughter, thank you), and I found birth control pills, some other unidentifiable pills, and a baggie of pot. Then, I hemmed and hawed around until I found Lindsey weeping over her weight&#x2014;she&#x2019;s five feet five inches tall and weighs one hundred and twenty pounds, the same as Gracie. She doesn&#x2019;t even have a freckle. Her date for the prom told her he couldn&#x2019;t go with her, that she was too fat. She was standing naked in front of the full-length mirror, sobbing and reading Sylvia Plath aloud&#x2014;remember her? She&#x2019;s the poet who stuck her head in the oven and killed herself. The final straw was the romantic dinner I had with Louie Provost at Epernay when his wife, Cherry, showed up to introduce herself. Um, didn&#x2019;t know there was a wife? Thanks, Louie. Can&#x2019;t have dinner there anymore.</p><p>I said to myself, Linda? You can definitely do better than this. All of a sudden it was clear to me that I had a stupid job and we had a very stupid life. So I called my sister and she said, Honey chile? You put yourself and your girls in your car and come on down to me!</p><p>So, that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m doing out here in the middle of the night in Virginia, traveling under the wing of all these trucks. But can you keep a secret? I quit my job. We&#x2019;re moving to Mount Pleasant and no one knows it except you and me. I know it seems slightly sneaky and a little impetuous but you know what? It&#x2019;s not. Look, if New Jersey has wanted us, it would have given us a reason to stay. It didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>I have to find a job. And that, my friend, should be the easiest part. I could get hired as a grave digger and make myself believe that I was working at Mardi Gras. But hey, brighter days and better days are coming. I can feel it in my bones! I really can. I am absolutely going to make this work.</p><p></p><p>Prologue</p><p>My mother always used to say that if a man could count his real friends on just one hand that he was a wealthy man indeed. My mother was right. I&#x2019;m going to tell you a story about heaven and hell and how I got out of one and found the other&#x2014;both with the help of a true-blue friend. Hell was being married to Loretta and working for her father. Heaven is our restaurant on Shem Creek, which we would never have had, except for the generosity and ingenuity of my best friend and partner, Robert. We call it Jackson Hole because my last name is Jackson and I guess you can say it is a hole in the wall. Yeah, it&#x2019;s definitely a hole in the wall. And, Robert like to ski guess where. I know. It&#x2019;s a less than nimble play on words, but let&#x2019;s get this on the record right now&#x2014;when the whole world conspires against you, a healthy sense of humor can be a very valuable tool. And, up until eight months ago, the world conspired. Worse, I was thrashing around in my quagmire of self-deception watching it happen and didn&#x2019;t do a thing about it.</p><p>I used to come down here all the time, in between deals, and I guess I&#x2019;ve been fishing the waters around Charleston for fifteen years. There isn&#x2019;t a creek in this whole area that hasn&#x2019;t seen the bottom of my boat, but that said, every time I dropped a hook in the salty creeks and rivets, it always seemed like the first time. The landscape and the light&#x2014;well, it was always a little different. Quiet but vibrant. You could have made yourself believe that the good Lord Himself was somewhere in the thicket, waiting patiently for you to remember that He was still there. It finally got to the point where I just left my boat in South Carolina. And my heart? Well, looking back, it seems now that the only time I ever thought about it was when I was floating on the Lowcountry waters.</p><p>We should discuss this heaven and hell thing, which all begins with my newly-acquired-at-great-personal-loss philosophy. Here it is in a nutshell. When you choose the wrong partner at the dance (whether it&#x2019;s marriage or profession), you will surely bust you ass.</p><p>Women seem to know this by instinct. Men don&#x2019;t. men are conditioned from birth to be providers and basically, our success is measured by how well we do that job. This somehow neatly translates to how much we earn and how many trophies we can accumulate over a lifetime. Cars, second houses, antiques, jewelry for the wife...;this list goes on and on. We have to graduate from the rights schools, become a partner in the right firm, marry the right girl, be invited to join the right club and develop a decent game of golf and tennis.</p><p>Right? Wrong! That entire unholy plan, my friends, is a truckload of manure.</p><p>Isn&#x2019;t it? I swear, I laugh now when I think about the years I spent chasing the almighty buck. Money, money, money. And, chasing the almighty buck with my wife, Loretta, who always was and continues to be a misery. Well, I can laugh now, but a few months ago, it was not funny at all.</p><p>Overall, daughters are so much luckier than sons. Their mothers tell them to follow their hearts, right? They say, Darlin&#x2019;? If you want to go study history, you go right ahead. Honey? If you want to be a chemist, go right ahead! Sure enough, women will graduate and can usually earn a decent living with their degree, doing something they love. Of course, women get screwed left and right because they don&#x2019;t earn the same money that their male colleagues do for performing the same jobs and for a whole variety of other reasons, but for the most part, I think women are happier in their professional lives. And yes, I guess you could say that I am kind of a male feminist.</p><p>But, sons are another matter entirely. When I look at the number of kids coming out of graduate school with business degrees, I am absolutely astonished. I mean, where are they all going to find the fortunes that they think are waiting for them? The ones they think they are entitled to? And law school? Don&#x2019;t get me started! Do we really need more lawyers?</p><p>What has happened to humanity is this. The world has become vicious, because the devil&#x2019;s real name is greed. Our ability to justify our greed is staggering. If you believe what you read, see and hear around you, our children&#x2019;s future will be all about heeding the call and joining the detestable clamor for money and power. It breaks your heart.</p><p>When I think about how I used to run my life, I am sure I must have been completely out of my mind. Besides working seventy-hour weeks, I used to read three newspapers every day&#x2014;The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. No more. Now I read the front page of the Post &amp; Courier and guess what? It&#x2019;s as much as I want to know about what&#x2019;s going on &#x201c;out there&#x201d;. And, I check the weather and the tide tables.</p><p>Let me ask you something. Have you ever been to Italy? Did you know that Italy has the sixth largest economy in the world? But when you go there, you see shops closed for hours in the middle of the day, everyone seems to be drinking wine and espresso, smoking Marlboro Reds, and it looks like no one&#x2019;s working! What is going on in Italy? Ahen. They are really living. And, guess what? Their lives last just as long as ours do. But! They&#x2019;re enjoying their lives one helluva lost more than we are. So, I said to myself, Brad? One day, you&#x2019;re gonna be dead and buried. That&#x2019;s when I decided to become Italian.</p><p>I want to have a romance with life! I want to love women and children and savor all the beauty and good to be found in the world. I was missing everything. So hitting rock bottom was a good thing. Otherwise, I&#x2019;d still be a hamster, running on a worthless, pointless wheel, racing to the grave.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Brad? Your appointment is here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, I&#x2019;ll be right there. Thanks!&#x201d;</p><p>That was Louise Waring. Who&#x2019;s she? Well, Louise is the greatest woman in the world, that&#x2019;s all. She runs the kitchen, everybody and everything. She&#x2019;s the chef when Duane takes days off, and the assistant chef when he&#x2019;s here. She is capable of almost anything, thank God. Shoot, just last week she stopped a knife fight in the kitchen between a busboy and a dishwasher. Seems one guy made a slanderous remark about the dubious nature of the other&#x2019;s birth, which was followed by a reference to the other fellow&#x2019;s lewd preference for his mother. Well, after that, the conversation switched to Spanish and could have escalated to life-threatening situation, but Louise stepped in and threatened to call the police. It&#x2019;s a good thing our customers don&#x2019;t know what goes on in the kitchen. It&#x2019;s bad enough what goes on in the dining room!</p><p>Rock bottom? It&#x2019;s almost embarrassing to tell you how I got there, but I&#x2019;ve been thinking about it a lot. I figure that if I can save some other poor son of a gun from the hell I went through then it&#x2019;s worth it to put my pride aside. No, I&#x2019;ve come to some very new conclusions and it all began with becoming separated from Loretta and going broke. I was forty-two, a smart fellow (or so I thought) with a platinum resume and suddenly I didn&#x2019;t have a pot to pee in or a window to throw it out of, like my grandfather used to say. It was the best thing that ever happened to me.</p><p>Look, you&#x2019;ll have to excuse me for just a few minutes. This interview shouldn&#x2019;t take very long. And, when I get back, I&#x2019;ll tell you why simplifying life is such a beautiful thing. Yep, think like an Indian and keep it simple. Just hold that thought.</p><p></p></p><h2>Maximum Ride Saving The World And Other Extreme Sports</h2><p>In MAXIMUM RIDE: SAVING THE WORLD AND OTHER EXTREME SPORTS, the time has arrived for Max and her winged &#34;Flock&#34; to face their ultimate enemy and discover their original purpose: to defeat the takeover of &#34;Re-evolution&#34;, a sinister experiment to re-engineer a select population into a scientifically superior master race...and to terminate the rest.

Capturing the ebullient spirit at the group&#x2019;s core, Jackson and Gans weave together a musical saga that examines the music and subculture that developed into its own economy, touching fans from all walks of life, from penniless hippies to celebrities, and at least one U.S. vice president. </p><p> This definitive book traces the Dead&#x2019;s evolution from its humble beginnings as a folk/bluegrass band playing small venues in Palo Alto to the feral psychedelic warriors and stadium-filling Americana jam band that blazed all the way through to the 90s. Along the way, we hear from many who were touched by the Dead&#x2015;from David Crosby and Miles Davis, to Ken Kesey, Carolyn &#x201c;Mountain Girl&#x201d; Garcia, and a host of Merry Pranksters, to legendary concert promoter Bill Graham, and others. </p><p>Throughout their journey the Dead broke (and sometimes rewrote) just about every rule of the music business, defying conventional wisdom and charting their own often unusual course, in the process creating a business model unlike any seen before. Musically, too, they were pioneers, fusing inspired ideas and techniques with intuition and fearlessness to craft an utterly unique and instantly recognizable sound. Their music centered on collective improvisation, spiritual and social democracy, trust, generosity, and fun. They believed that you can make something real, spontaneous, and compelling happen with other musicians if you trust and encourage each other, and jam as if your life depended on it.

[T]he editors have pulled off the pretty neat hat trick of filling in plenty of cracks for the hard core while providing a basic education for novices.

It is down-to-earth, plainspoken, without special pleading or arguments for differing levels of awareness. You didn't have to be there. On many pages, this could be the story of any band-the story as it emerges here carries no pretensions-and elsewhere it is the story of people doing their work.

He writes full-time and lives in Florida with his family.<br>The first two entries in the series, Witch &amp; Wizard (2009) and The Gift (2010), were slapdash, hackneyed affairs involving hastily thrown-together characters and a generically totalitarian future government headed by the evil The One. Thankfully, this apparent conclusion benefits from having to tie together the various threads, resulting in a tighter, more coherent story line. With the teen Resistance in tatters, magical siblings Whit and Wisty are forced to split up to achieve two seemingly impossible goals: save their maybe-not-dead-after-all parents from the Shadowland and destroy The One once and for all. Though the duo&#x2019;s endless array of powers (healing, creating food, morphing bodies, reading minds, shooting flame, freezing people in place) drains most of the tension from otherwise decently constructed action scenes, Patterson&#x2019;s trademark short chapters at least keep things swift. Meanwhile, the series hits its highest point of interest when it finally gives a glimpse into the childhood of The One. A better-than-expected ending to a by-the-numbers trilogy. We can hope it&#x2019;s a trilogy, anyway. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: Patterson, one of the best-selling authors of all time, is review-proof. The first two volumes set the tone: heavy advertising, graphic-novel supplementation, best-seller lists. Expect the same. Grades 6-9. --Daniel Kraus</p><h2>Fire and Brimstone: The North Butte Mining Disaster of 1917</h2><p><strong>The author of the #1 <em>New York Times </em>bestseller, <em>The Revenant </em>-- basis for the award-winning motion picture starring Leonardo DiCaprio -- tells the remarkable story of the worst hard-rock mining disaster in American history. <br></strong><br>A half-hour before midnight on June 8, 1917, a fire broke out in the North Butte Mining Company's Granite Mountain shaft. Sparked more than two thousand feet below ground, the fire spewed flames, smoke, and poisonous gas through a labyrinth of underground tunnels. Within an hour, more than four hundred men would be locked in a battle to survive. Within three days, one hundred and sixty-four of them would be dead.<br><br><em>Fire and Brimstone</em> recounts the remarkable stories of both the men below ground and their families above, focusing on two groups of miners who made the incredible decision to entomb themselves to escape the gas. While the disaster is compelling in its own right, <em>Fire and Brimstone</em> also tells a far broader story striking in its contemporary relevance. Butte, Montana, on the eve of the North Butte disaster, was a volatile jumble of antiwar protest, an abusive corporate master, seething labor unrest, divisive ethnic tension, and radicalism both left and right. It was a powder keg lacking only a spark, and the mine fire would ignite strikes, murder, ethnic and political witch hunts, occupation by federal troops, and ultimately a battle over presidential power.</p><p><strong>Michael Punke</strong> grew up on the North Platte River in Wyoming. During his teenage years he spent three summers as a "living history interpreter" at Fort Laramie National Historic Site. His professional experience includes work for a Montana senator and a stint on the White House Staff. He lives in Montana with his wife and two children.In this compelling tale, Punke recounts the grim details of the worst hard-rock mining disaster in United States history. On June 8, 1917, a fire broke out in the main shaft of a huge complex of copper mines 2,000 feet beneath Granite Mountain in Butte, Mont. The fire raged for three days, killing 164 of the 400 or so men at work that day. Punke, a Washington, D.C., lawyer and novelist (<i>The Revenant</i>), takes the reader deep underground and into the heart of the calamity. If the horrifying account of the fire and the trapped men is the heart of this yarn, its soul is Punke's historical contextualization of the event. He paints a vivid picture of a city, state and nation in the grip of industrial monopolies. In Butte, copper was king and Standard Oil, in the guise of Anaconda Mining, owned most of the copper (though not the Granite Mountain mine). In Punke's telling, Standard Oil spent lavishly to control the municipal and state governments; they aggressively fought the miners' union. Immediately after the tragic fire, the workers violently vented their fury on the hated Anaconda. Like the hardworking miners he writes about, Punke gets the job done, with sturdy prose.<i> (Aug. 8)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She is <i>The New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Agatha Raisin mysteries, including <i>As the Pig Turns</i> and <i>Busy Body</i>, set in the English Cotswolds, as well as the Hamish Macbeth mysteries set in Scotland. She has also written historical romance novels and an Edwardian mystery series under the name Marion Chesney. Before writing her first novels, Beaton worked as a bookseller, a newspaper reporter, a fashion critic, and a waitress in a greasy spoon. Born in Scotland, she currently divides her time between Paris and a village in the Cotswolds. She was selected the British Guest of Honor for the Bouchercon World Mystery Convention in 2006.&nbsp; THE QUICHE OF DEATH ONE <br> <br> MRS. Agatha Raisin sat behind her newly cleared desk in her office in South Molton Street in London&#x2019;s Mayfair. From the outer office came the hum of voices and the clink of glasses as the staff prepared to say farewell to her. For Agatha was taking early retirement. She had built up the public-relations firm over long hard years of work. She had come a long way from her working-class background in Birmingham. She had survived an unfortunate marriage and had come out of it, divorced and battered in spirit, but determined to succeed in life. All her business efforts were to one end, the realization of a dream&#x2014;a cottage in the Cotswolds. The Cotswolds in the Midlands are surely one of the few man-made beauties in the world: quaint villages of golden stone houses, pretty gardens, winding green lanes and ancient churches. Agatha had been taken to the Cotswolds as a child for one brief magical holiday. Her parents had hated it and had said that they should have gone to Butlin&#x2019;s Holiday Camp as usual, but to Agatha the Cotswolds represented everything she wanted in life: beauty, tranquillity and security. So even as a child, she had become determined that one day she would live in one of those pretty cottages in a quiet peaceful village, far from the noise and smells of the city. During all her time in London, she had, until just recently, never gone back to the Cotswolds, preferring to keep the dream intact. Now she had purchased that dream cottage in the village of Carsely. It was a pity, thought Agatha, that the village was called plain Carsely and not Chipping Campden or Aston Magna or Lower Slaughter or one of those intriguing Cotswold names, but the cottage was perfect and the village not on the tourist route, which meant freedom from craft shops, tea-rooms and daily bus parties. Agatha was aged fifty-three, with plain brown hair and a plain square face and a stocky figure. Her accent was as Mayfair as could be except in moments of distress or excitement, when the old nasal Birmingham voice of her youth crept through. It helps in public relations to have a certain amount of charm and Agatha had none. She got results by being a sort of one-woman soft-cop/hard-cop combination; alternately bullying and wheedling on behalf of her clients. Journalists often gave space to her clients just to get rid of her. She was also an expert at emotional blackmail and anyone unwise enough to accept a present or a free lunch from Agatha was pursued shamelessly until they paid back in kind. She was popular with her staff because they were a rather weak, frivolous lot, the kind of people who build up legends about anyone of whom they are frightened. Agatha was described as &#x201c;a real character,&#x201d; and like all real characters who speak their mind, she did not have any real friends. Her work had been her social life as well. As she rose to go through and join the party, a small cloud crossed the horizon of Agatha&#x2019;s usually uncomplicated mind. Before her lay days of nothing: no work from morning till night, no bustle or noise. How would she cope? She shrugged the thought away and crossed the Rubicon into the outer office to say her farewells. &#x201c;Here she comes!&#x201d; screeched Roy, one of her assistants. &#x201c;Made some special champagne punch, Aggie. Real knickerrotter.&#x201d; Agatha accepted a glass of punch. Her secretary, Lulu, approached and handed her a gift-wrapped parcel and then the others crowded around with their offerings. Agatha felt a lump rising in her throat. A little insistent voice was chattering in her head, &#x201c;What have you done? What have you <i>done?</i>&#x201d; There was a bottle of scent from Lulu and, predictably, a pair of crotchless panties from Roy; there was a book on gardening from one, a vase from another, and so it went on. &#x201c;Speech!&#x201d; cried Roy. &#x201c;Thank you all,&#x201d; said Agatha gruffly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to China, you know. You&#x2019;ll all be able to come and see me. Your new bosses, Pedmans, have promised not to change anything, so I suppose life will go on for all of you much the same. Thank you for my presents. I will treasure them, except for yours, Roy. I doubt if at my age I&#x2019;ll find any use for them.&#x201d; &#x201c;You never know your luck,&#x201d; said Roy. &#x201c;Some horny farmer&#x2019;ll probably be chasing you through the shrubbery.&#x201d; Agatha drank more punch and ate smoked-salmon sandwiches and then, with her presents packed by Lulu into two carrier bags, she made her way down the stairs of Raisin Promotions for the last time. In Bond Street, she elbowed a thin, nervous business man aside who had just flagged down a cab, said unrepentantly, &#x201c;I saw it first,&#x201d; and ordered the driver to take her to Paddington Station. She caught the 15:20 train to Oxford and sank back into the corner seat of a first-class carriage. Everything was ready and waiting for her in the Cotswolds. An interior decorator had &#x201c;done over&#x201d; the cottage, her car was waiting for her at Moreton-in-Marsh station for the short drive to Carsely, a removal firm had taken all her belongings from her London flat, now sold. She was free. She could relax. No temperamental pop stars to handle, no prima-donnaish couture firms to launch. All she had to do from now on was to please herself. Agatha drifted off to sleep and awoke with a start at the guard&#x2019;s cry of &#x201c;Oxford. This is Oxford. The train terminates here.&#x201d; Not for the first time, Agatha wondered about British Rail&#x2019;s use of the word &#x201c;terminate.&#x201d; One expected the train to blow apart. Why not just say &#x201c;stops here&#x201d;? She looked up at the screen, like a dingy television set, which hung over Platform 2. It informed her that the train to Charlbury, Kingham, Moreton-in-Marsh and all further points to Hereford was on Platform 3, and lugging her carrier bags, she walked over the bridge. The day was cold and grey. The euphoria produced by freedom from work and Roy&#x2019;s punch was slowly beginning to evaporate. The train moved slowly out of the station. Glimpses of barges on one side and straggly allotments on the other and then flat fields flooded from the recent rain lay gloomily in front of her increasingly jaundiced view. This is ridiculous, thought Agatha. I&#x2019;ve got what I always wanted. I&#x2019;m tired, that&#x2019;s all. The train stopped somewhere outside Charlbury, gliding to a stop and sitting there placidly in the inexplicable way that British Rail trains often do. The passengers sat stoically, listening to the rising wind whining over the bleak fields. Why are we like sheep that have gone astray? wondered Agatha. Why are the British so cowed and placid? Why does no one shout for the guard and demand to know the reason? Other, more voluble, races would not stand for it. She debated whether to go and see the guard herself. Then she remembered she was no longer in a hurry to get anywhere. She took out a copy of the <i>Evening Standard,</i> which she had bought at the station, and settled down to read it. After twenty minutes the train creaked slowly into life. Another twenty minutes after Charlbury and it slid into the little station of Moreton-in-Marsh. Agatha climbed out. Her car was still where she had left it. During the last few minutes of the journey she had begun to worry that it might have been stolen. It was market day in Moreton-in-Marsh and Agatha&#x2019;s spirits began to revive as she drove slowly past stalls selling everything from fish to underwear. Tuesday. Market day was Tuesday. She must remember that. Her new Saab purred out of Moreton and then up through Bourton-on-the-Hill. Nearly home. Home! Home at last. She turned off the A-44 and then began the slow descent to the village of Carsely, which nestled in a fold of the Cotswold Hills. It was a very pretty village, even by Cotswold standards. There were two long lines of houses interspersed with shops, some low and thatched, some warm gold brick with slate roofs. There was a pub called the Red Lion at one end and a church at the other. A few straggling streets ran off this one main road where cottages leaned together as if for support in their old age. The gardens were bright with cherry blossom, forsythia and daffodils. There was an old-fashioned haberdasher&#x2019;s, a post office and general store, and a butcher&#x2019;s, and a shop that seemed to sell nothing other than dried flowers and to be hardly ever open. Outside the village and tucked away from view by a rise was a council estate and between the council estate and the village proper was the police station, an elementary school, and a library. Agatha&#x2019;s cottage stood alone at the end of one of the straggling side streets. It looked like a cottage in one of the calendars she used to treasure as a girl. It was low and thatched, new thatch, Norfolk reed, and with casement windows and built of the golden Cotswold stone. There was a small garden at the front and a long narrow one at the back. Unlike practically everyone else in the Cotswolds, the previous owner had not been a gardener. There was little else but grass and depressing bushes of the hard-wearing kind found in public parks. Inside there was a small dark cubby-hole of a hall. To the right was the living-room; to the left, the dining-room, and the kitchen at the back was part of a recent extension and was large and square. Upstairs were two low-ceilinged bedrooms and a bathroom. All the ceilings were beamed. Agatha had given the interior decorator a free hand. It was all as it should be and yet &#x2026; Agatha paused at the door of the living-room. Three-piece suite in covered Sanderson&#x2019;s linen, lamps, coffee-table with glass top, fake medieval fire-basket in the hearth, horse brasses nailed to the fireplace, pewter tankards and toby jugs hanging from the beams and bits of polished farm machinery decorating the walls, and yet it looked like a stage set. She went into the kitchen and switched on the central heating. The super-duper removal company had even put her clothes in the bedroom and her books on the shelves, so there was not much for her to do. She went through to the dining-room. Long table, shining under its heat-resistant surface, Victorian dining chairs, Edwardian painting of a small child in a frock in a bright garden, Welsh dresser with blue-and-white plates, another fireplace with a fake-log electric fire, and a drinks trolley. Upstairs, the bedrooms were pure Laura Ashley. It felt like someone else&#x2019;s house, the home of some characterless stranger, or an expensive holiday cottage. Well, she had nothing for dinner and after a life of restaurants and take-aways, Agatha had planned to learn how to cook, and there were all her new cookery books in a gleaming row on a shelf in the kitchen. She collected her handbag and made her way out. Time to investigate what few village shops there were. Many of the shops, the real estate agent had told her, had closed down and had been transformed into &#x201c;des rezzes,&#x201d; or desirable residences. The villagers blamed the incomers, but it was the motor car which had caused the damage, the villagers themselves preferring to go to the supermarkets of Stratford or Evesham for their goods rather than buy them at a higher price in the village. Most people in the village owned some sort of car. As Agatha approached the main street, an old man was coming the other way. He touched his cap and gave her a cheerful &#x201c;arternoon.&#x201d; Then in the main street, everyone she passed greeted her with a few words, a casual &#x201c;afternoon&#x201d; or &#x201c;nasty weather.&#x201d; Agatha brightened. After London, where she had not even known her neighbours, all this friendliness was a refreshing change. She studied the butcher&#x2019;s window and then decided that cookery could wait for a few days and so passed on to the general store and bought a &#x201c;very hot&#x201d; Vindaloo curry to microwave and a can of rice. Again, in the store, she was met with friendliness all round. At the door of the shop was a box of second-hand books. Agatha had always read &#x201c;improving&#x201d; books, mostly non-fiction. There was a battered copy of <i>Gone With the Wind</i> and she bought it on impulse. Back in her cottage, she found a basket of pseudo-logs by the fire, little round things made out of pressed sawdust. She piled some up in the grate and set fire to them and soon had a blaze roaring up the chimney. She removed the lace antimacassar which the decorator had cutely draped over the television screen and switched it on. There was some war going on, as there usually was, and it was getting the usual coverage; that is, the anchorman and the reporter were having a cosy talk. &#x201c;Over to you, John. What is the situation now? Well, Peter &#x2026;&#x201d; By the time they moved on to the inevitable &#x201c;expert&#x201d; in the studio, Agatha wondered why they bothered to send any reporter out to the war at all. It was like the Gulf War all over again, where most of the coverage seemed to consist of a reporter standing in front of a palm tree outside some hotel in Riyadh. What a waste of money. He never had much information and it would surely have been cheaper to place him in front of a palm tree in a studio in London. She switched it off and picked up <i>Gone With the Wind.</i> She had been looking forward to a piece of intellectual slumming to celebrate her release from work, but she was amazed at how very good it was, almost <i>indecently</i> readable, thought Agatha, who had only read before the sort of books you read to impress people. The fire crackled and Agatha read until her rumbling stomach prompted her to put the curry in the microwave. Life was good. <br> <br>But a week passed, a week in which Agatha, in her usual headlong style, had set out to see the sights. She had been to Warwick Castle, Shakespeare&#x2019;s birthplace, Blenheim Palace, and had toured through the villages of the Cotswolds while the wind blew and the rain fell steadily from grey skies, returning every evening to her silent cottage with only a new-found discovery of Agatha Christie to help her through the evenings. She had tried visiting the pub, the Red Lion, a jolly low-raftered chintzy sort of place with a cheerful landlord. And the locals had talked to her as they always did with a peculiar sort of open friendliness that never went any further. Agatha could have coped with a suspicious animosity but not this cheerful welcome which somehow still held her at bay. Not that Agatha had ever known how to make friends, but there was something about the villagers, she discovered, which repelled incomers. They did not reject them. On the surface they welcomed them. But Agatha knew that her presence made not a ripple on the calm pond of village life. No one asked her to tea. No one showed any curiosity about her whatsoever. The vicar did not even call. In an Agatha Christie book the vicar would have called, not to mention some retired colonel and his wife. All conversation seemed limited to &#x201c;Mawnin&#x2019;,&#x201d; &#x201c;Afternoon,&#x201d; or talk about the weather. For the first time in her life, she knew loneliness, and it frightened her. From the kitchen windows at the back of the house was a view of the Cotswold Hills, rising up to bock out the world of bustle and commerce, trapping Agatha like some baffled alien creature under the thatch of her cottage, cut off from life. The little voice that had cried, &#x201c;What have I done?&#x201d; became a roar. And then she suddenly laughed. London was only an hour and a half away on the train, not thousands of miles. She would take herself up the following day, see her former staff, have lunch at the Caprice, and then perhaps raid the bookshops for some more readable material. She had missed market day in Moreton, but there was always another week. As if to share her mood, the sun shone down on a perfect spring day. The cherry tree at the end of her back garden, the one concession to beauty that the previous owner had seen fit to make, raised heavy branches of flowers to a clear blue sky as Agatha had her usual breakfast of one cup of black coffee, instant, and two filter-tipped...</p><h2>Matthew 14-28 (Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture, NT Volume 1B)</h2><p>The Gospel of Matthew stands out as a favorite biblical text among patristic commentators. The patristic commentary tradition on Matthew begins with Origen's pioneering twenty-five-volume commentary on the First Gospel in the mid-third century. In the Latin-speaking West, where commentaries did not appear until about a century later, the first commentary on Matthew was written by Hilary of Poitiers in the mid-fourth century. From that point the First Gospel became one of the texts most frequently commented on in patristic exegesis. Outstanding examples are Jerome's four-volume commentary and the valuable but anonymous and incomplete <em>Opus imperfectum in Matthaeum.</em> Then there are the Greek <em>catena</em> fragments derived from commentaries by Theodore of Heraclea, Apollinaris of Laodicea, Theodore of Mopsuestia and Cyril of Alexandria. The ancient homilies also provide ample comment, including John Chrysostom's ninety homilies and Chromatius of Aquileia's fifty-nine homilies on the Gospel of Matthew. In addition, there are various Sunday and feast-day homilies from towering figures such as Augustine and Gregory the Great, as well as other fathers. This rich abundance of patristic comment, much of it presented here in English translation for the first time by editor Manlio Simonetti, provides a bountiful and varied feast of ancient interpretation of the First Gospel.</p><p>Manlio Simonetti, a widely acknowledged expert in patristic biblical interpretation, teaches at the University of Rome and at the Augustinian Patristic Institute in Rome. He is the author of several books and Bible commentaries, including <em>Biblical Interpretation in the Early Church: An Historical Introduction to Patristic Exegesis</em> (T T Clark)."This volume continues the valuable exploration of patristic interpretation." (Mark Bilby, Religious Studies Review, September 2009)<br><br>"A 'must' for all theological libraries." (International Review of Biblical Studies, Vol. 55, 2008-2009)<br><br>"A wealth of information for the classic Bible scholar." (Ravonne A. Green, American Reference Books Annual, 2006, Volume 37)<br><br>"Contemporary Christians would do well to draw the hermeneutical circle broadly enough to include not only cross-cultural voices from around the world but also the voices to be found in the Ancient Christian Commentary series. This is an excellent sermon-preparation resource for pastors." (Christian Century, May 2, 2006)<br><br>"All who are interested in the interpretation of the Bible will welcome the forthcoming multivolume series Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture. Here the insights of scores of early church fathers will be assembled and made readily available for significant passages throughout the Bible and the Apocrypha. It is hard to think of a more worthy ecumenical project to be undertaken by InterVarsity Press." (Bruce M. Metzger, professor emeritus of New Testament, Princeton Theological Seminary)<br><br>"For those who think that church history began around 1941, when their pastor was born, this commentary will be a great surprise. Christians throughout the centuries have read the biblical text and nursed their spirits with it and then applied it to their lives. These commentaries reflect that the witness of the Holy Spirit was present in his church throughout the centuries. As a result, we can profit by allowing the ancient Christians to speak to us today." (Haddon Robinson, Harold John Ockenga Distinguished Professor of Preaching, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary)<br><br>"There is no shortage of new books on the market and it may be a surprise to some to see IVP producing the Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture series. But, bearing in mind C. S. Lewis's admonition, 'It is a good rule, after reading a new book, never to allow yourself another new one till you have read an old one in between,' this series will fill a great need that many of us may not even be aware of--the need to read those who have gone before us." (D. Stuart Briscoe)<br><br>"We speak abstractly in scholarly circles of the need to transcend looking at Christianity through the spectrum of modern presuppositions. This series, based on the commentaries of early Christians, gives us a concrete way to do this. It's a great idea." (Don S. Browning, Alexander Campbell Professor of Ethics and Social Sciences, The Divinity School, University of Chicago)<br><br>"The Scriptures have been read with love and attention for nearly two thousand years, and listening to the voice of believers from previous centuries opens us to unexpected insight and deepened faith. Those who studied Scripture in the centuries closest to its writing, the centuries during and following persecution and martyrdom, speak with particular authority. The Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture will bring to life the truth that we are invisibly surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses." (Frederica Mathewes-Green, commentator, National Public Radio)<br><br>"Composed in the style of the great medieval <em>catenae,</em> this new anthology of patristic commentary on Holy Scripture, conveniently arranged by chapter and verse, will be a valuable resource for prayer, study and proclamation. By calling attention to the rich Christian heritage preceding the separations between East and West and between Protestant and Catholic, this series will perform a major service to the cause of ecumenism."

But some sought more than wealth. Val Trevallion, a loner haunted by a violent past. Grita Redaway, a radiantly beautiful actress driven by an unfulfilled need. Two fiercely independent spirits, together they rose above the challenges of the Comstock to stake a bold claim on the future.</p><p>Our foremost storyteller of the American West, <b>Louis L&#x2019;Amour </b>has thrilled a nation by chronicling the adventures of the brave men and woman who settled the frontier. There are more than three hundred million copies of his books in print around the world.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>It began with a dream, a dream that ended in horror.<br><br>It began in a thatched cottage with wind around it and rain beating on the shutters, with a flagstone floor and the smell of fish frying, and his mother putting blue plates on the table and his father sitting by the fire. It began in Cornwall, in England, in 1849.<br><br>It began with listening to the storm blowing in from the sea and the fire hissing from occasional drops that fell down the chimney.<br><br>It began with Val Trevallion's father saying, "Mary, we are going to America."<br><br>His mother stopped, holding a blue plate in her two hands, staring at his father.<br><br>"We are going to California, to the goldfields. There will be no more mines for our son, and this day I have decided."<br><br>Tom Trevallion leaned over and knocked his pipe empty of ash on the edge of the hearth. "Tomorrow we will go to Gunwalloe."<br><br>"But aren't there mines in the goldfields?"<br><br>"It is placer-mining like we tinners used to do before the deep mines began. A man need not go underground there, nor a lad, either.<br><br>"Look at him! He has been a year in the mines now and the color is gone from him. He was a fine lad with a fine brown color to him when he worked with the fishing. I'll not have it, Mary. He shall not live hidden from the sun as I have."<br><br>"But how can we, Tom?"<br><br>"I've put by a little . . . not enough, but something. And we shall go to Gunwalloe by the sea for a few days."<br><br>"To Gunwalloe? Oh!" She realized her husband was speaking of the treasure. "But it is useless. So many have tried, and some of them for years."<br><br>"Aye. Yet I have been told a thing or two. I have spent days and nights with old Tregor. The man's dying now and well he knows it. He's always liked me, Mary&#x2014;"<br><br>"Your grandfather was shipmates with him. They went through it together, those two."<br><br>"He's whispered a thing to me, the old man has, and nothing about the money-ship, she from whom the coins wash ashore from time to time. 'Tis another vessel entirely, their own vessel. When she was sinking off the Lizard some of the men escaped overside, each with his own keeping, the share each man had for himself. They tried to run up the coast to Gunwalloe where they had friends, but it was a bloody beast of a gale, and they went on the rocks off there, and only grandfather and old Tregor reached the shore.<br><br>"Most of what they had, and those with them, still lies yonder, off the rocks. No great treasure, mind you, but enough for California, I'm thinking."<br><br>"But if you start diving off the rocks you'll have half the village around you!"<br><br>"At night, Mary, only at night. On the last days of fishing . . . 'twas then I found the wreck.<br><br>"We've but one son, Mary, and he must have his chance. In the old days of tinners it was not a bad thing, working along the streams and such. We were out in the air and working for ourselves only. Now it is the big companies who have it all, and they do not like me, Mary. We tinners were a different breed, too free to suit them.<br><br>"It's for America we are, a bit of land and a cow, some chickens for eggs, and a horse or two for riding or driving to a cart."<br><br>His father was dark of visage, as Val would be, a man square-shouldered and powerful from hard work and the lifting. A man who talked little but was listened to because of the manner he had. Those in charge at the mines liked his father little because of his straight back and the way he looked right at them when he spoke. Yet they kept him on because he was the best of them.<br><br>Val himself had gone into the mines at the age of twelve, as did most boys, but it was the change in him that led his father to move. That and some drive within himself that asked for better things.<br><br>The day the Trevallions left for Gunwalloe was a memorable one. Jenkins, the owner himself, had come around to the house to ask his father back, a thing unheard of, with all the village watching from behind doors and curtains.<br><br>"Leave now, man, and you canna come back. I will not have my men coming and going."<br><br>"I shall not come back," Tom Trevallion said. "There are mines over the sea, and I shall have one of my own."<br><br>"Fool's talk! What do you know of gold? You're a tinner and a copper man, maybe, but gold? 'Tis another thing."<br><br>"I can learn."<br><br>"Have you money enough then?"<br><br>"We've put some by, and I'll sell the house."<br><br>Val stood beside his father, a proud lad to see it, for never before had the owner come down to a miner's cottage to ask after any man.<br><br>His father looked the owner in the eye and said, "Why don't you come yourself, then? Sell this and come out to California. This&#x2014;" he waved a hand, "is but a teapot operation to what you will find there."<br><br>This made the owner angry. "A teapot opera&#x2014;"<br><br>"You're a canny man," his father said, "you would do well, yon."<br><br>Jenkins grunted his disdain. "You dare to advise me? You'll starve over there, if you manage to leave at all. You will starve or drown or be killed by savages."<br><br>He started to turn away, his back stiff with offense. "You have been given your chance to forget such nonsense but now I'll not have you. Go, then! Go!"<br><br>Jenkins strode away down the street, anger and damaged pride in every step. His father had turned to see his mother smiling. "Ah, Tom, if starve it is to be I shall starve a proud woman! Who would think to hear the owner told so completely. You are a bold man, Tom."<br><br>"I shall needs be bold. Do not think I go lightly from here, Mary. We shall face trouble. But now we will go to Gunwalloe."<br><br>"You will sell the cottage?"<br><br>"I have spoken to Edward Bayne, the new man who keeps the shop, and he would be having it from me, and a fair price, too."<br><br>Val had looked up at his father then and asked, "Is it far to California?"<br><br>"It is far . . . very far, I am told."<br><br>"Will we go upon a ship?"<br><br>"A very small ship, I am afraid, with very many other people. Then, when we get to America, I must find work and when we know what we are about, we must buy a wagon--"<br><br>"A wagon?"<br><br>"Aye. One is needed for the crossing of the great plains. We will need cattle for the drawing of it, and a horse for riding. And a rifle-gun for shooting game."<br><br>"But what of the wardens?" Mary protested.<br><br>"There are no wardens. The game run wild for any to hunt who will."<br><br>"Have you shot a rifle?"<br><br>"I have not. Nor have I so much as held one in my hands. Here in England only the great landowners may hunt, so the only guns I have seen were in the hands of soldiers. But I shall learn. We all must learn."<br><br>"Father? What are 'plains'?"<br><br>"It is like a moor. It is grassland, miles upon miles of it, with no trees but those along the streams, and there are few streams."<br><br>"Tom? Is it as far as London? To cross the plains, I mean?"<br><br>He looked at her, smiling. "Will Holder, you know? He who returned to Helston for his family? He said it would be five months in the crossing . . . perhaps six."<br><br>He paused. "It is very far. We must carry with us all we will need. It will cost us dear to go to California, Mary, but it will be worth it.<br><br>"Do you remember Will Holder? He left here with nothing, and when he came back he wore fine clothes, had new boots, and with money to spend."<br><br>They went down the road in the morning to Gun-walloe by the sea, and they went to the house where Mary Trevallion was born and where her brother Tony still lived. "You still have the boat?" his father asked.<br><br>"Aye." Tony was a stocky man with a blue kerchief at his throat and a leather coat. "You have need of a boat?"<br><br>"There are fish in the sea, yonder. If you will help you may have a bit of what I catch."<br><br>"You will catch nothing if you seek more than fish. John Knill searched long for the King of Portugal's ship but found nothing. You will find nothing, too."<br><br>"Have you a memory for old Tregor?"<br><br>"Who does not, who lives in Gunwalloe? He was of this place, but always away upon the sea, and when at last he came back, he came walking up from the sea, all dripping and soaked. I remember it well. He staggered from the waves like a man drunken. And then away he went to live out his years in Mullion."<br><br>"Did he not come back to Gunwalloe at all?"<br><br>"He did. A time or two he returned for the fishing and to share a pint or two in the tavern."<br><br>"All those years? What did he live on then?"<br><br>Tony shrugged. "It is said he cared for horses for the Godolphins."<br><br>"What he lived on," his father had said, "was what he brought back from the seas. Old Tregor is dying now, and he left to me what is out there, and when I have had what I need, the rest is for you. When Old Tregor went out fishing he was actually diving, at a place he knew. There's no enormous treasure, just some packets of it, and rich enough for the likes of you and me.<br><br>"When I have had mine there will be a bit left. Use it sparingly, and let no man or woman know what you have, and there will always be a loaf in the cupboard and a pint on the table."<br><br>When the morning came they went down the coast for the fishing, and when dark was coming on, they crept back up the coast and dropped anchor off the rocks. While Tony sat with a line out, Tom Trevallion dove down, and when he came up he held a small box, and in it were a few gold coins and a piece or two of jewelry. Then, while he rested, Tony went down and came up with a canvas sack, small but with gold coins also, a silver buckle, and some odds and ends.<br><br>It was not much, for it was what each man had for himself before the big treasure was divided, that stormy night long ago. But each man brought the share he had at hand when they fled the boat, before it broke up and sank off Gunwalloe. Tregor had lived his life away on what remained of one or two of the shares.<br><br>Tony kept only one gold coin for himself, but came away with the knowledge of where the boat lay. At least two more packets were down there, and possibly a third.<br><br>The morning after, Tony drove the Trevallions in his cart to Falmouth, a far piece. The ship lay there, small, dirty, and overcrowded, but a ship.<br><br>Only hours later they were at sea. Val loved the great sails, the creak of the bumpkins, and the rush of water along the hull. The storms frightened him, yet "I could be a sailor," he told his father.<br><br>" 'Tis a dog's life, that. Work by day and by night, and naught but poor food and much abuse with small payment at the end."<br><br>"But they are out in the air!" Val protested.<br><br>"Aye," his father agreed, "there is that."<br><br>"When we reach America we will not go to California at once?"<br><br>"Will Holder advised against it. First, he said, we should come to know the people and the climate of things. A newcomer can make mistakes."<br><br>"Have we enough, then?" Mary asked.<br><br>"With care we've what is needed for California and to hold us a bit until I can earn."<br><br>"It seems a lot . . . the gold, I mean."<br><br>"Not much when we think of all that must be bought. A wagon, oxen, a horse, a rifle, and much food. Will says a poor man cannot go west, it is too expensive by far."<br><br>Val's father and mother talked of little else but California and what they would do there and how they should live. It seemed a far off, magnificent dream, but all aboard the ship were dreaming, some of one thing and some of another.<br><br>Gold was everywhere, people said, they had simply to pick it off the bottom of streams, or wash it from the earth. Tom Trevallion smiled at that.<br><br>"They will sing another tune when they have worked at it for a few hours. We tinners grew up panning for tin before the big mines took over everything. It is hard, hard work."<br><br>A Yorkshireman who slept near them spoke up. "You may have your gold and your California. I am for Oregon. I want no gold, just the good earth. Let me dip my hands in good black loam and feel the richness of it in my fingers.<br><br>"Treat the earth kindly, my friends, and it will give you comfort, security, and all a man may need. If you plant a flake of gold in the earth, will anything come of it? But plant a seed and it will repay you many times over."<br><br>Their ship took them to New Orleans, and a river steamer to Westport. In New Orleans they all bought new clothes. "We will need them," his father advised, "they will be cheaper here than in St. Louis or Westport."<br><br>At Westport suddenly their plans changed. Mary Trevallion saw a woman crying. She was seated in the lobby of the small tavern where they had taken a room until they found a wagon in which to live and travel.<br><br>"Tom," Mary said suddenly, "this woman's husband has died. She is left with two small children and a wagon and stock she cannot use."<br><br>"She will have no trouble selling them here."<br><br>"Why not to us?"<br><br>The woman looked up. "If you will buy today I will sell cheap. I want to go home. I want to go back to my folks."<br><br>The wagon was strongly built and painted blue. Tom Trevallion, who knew much of such things, examined it carefully.<br><br>"You can have the oxen&#x2014;there are eight head&#x2014;for two hundred dollars. The wagon should be worth fifty."</p><h2>Rapture (Fallen)</h2><p><p><b>The conclusion to the worldwide bestselling FALLEN series, with exclusive content from the darkly romantic&nbsp;world of FALLEN and an excerpt of Lauren Kate's novel TEARDROP.<br><b><br>A&nbsp;<i>USA Today</i> bestseller<br><b><b>A&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling series</b></b><br>More than 3 million series copies in print!</b><br><br>When evil triumphs . . . when the world ends . . . trust your love.<br><br></b>The sky is dark with wings. . . .

Cast,&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling author on&nbsp;<i>Fallen</i></b>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b> Amazon Exclusive: Q&amp;A with Lauren Kate</b></p> <p> <strong>Q. Rapture is the fourth and final book in the best-selling <em>Fallen</em> series&#x2014;how does it feel to have finished writing this story?</strong></p> <p> <strong>A. </strong>I wept while writing this book&#x2014;a first for me. At this point, I just feel joy at getting to share the story. I&#x2019;m ready to release Luce and Daniel into the universe. The three of us do each other proud in this book: Luce transforms into an inspiring force of nature and Daniel proves himself worthy of her love. These two outcomes were not inevitable at the start of the series.&nbsp; I have given them an ending I think is worthy of their journey--it was the only possible ending for them.&nbsp; I hope it makes readers say, &#x201c;Yes, that&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;</p> <p> This sense of closure does not extend to the other characters in the series. I&#x2019;m working on a new book now, set in a completely different world, with an unrelated cast of characters. The other day I was writing a scene, and I kept having to stop myself from thinking: You know who&#x2019;d know just what to say here? Roland!</p> <p> <strong>Q. In <em>Rapture</em> we finally find out how Daniel and Lucinda meet&#x2014;I won&#x2019;t spoil it, but I will say it was an amazing revelation. (I did not see it coming, and I totally cried.) When you started writing <em>Fallen</em>, did you already know how Daniel and Luce first met? Or was it something that came to you while you were writing?</strong></p> <p> <strong>A. </strong>It was Luce who determined that this first meeting become so revelatory, not me. I didn&#x2019;t realize how much it mattered until she kept bringing it up. (Having parted ways with the cast of <em>Fallen</em>, I see how the characters&#x2019; autonomies resided at the limits of my subconscious. When it seemed as if a character knew more about a situation than I did, I learned to follow his or her instinct to the edge of the universe.) In Passion, the at-first-sight moment&#x2019;s elusiveness was like a delicious cupcake floating in front of a winged horse: If only Luce could work hard enough, go back far enough in time, she was bound to find it. And it was bound to tell her everything, right? This is a girl, remember, who&#x2019;s had hundreds of lives, hundreds of origins, but she was looking for the most primal one, the source.</p> <p> I didn&#x2019;t know the details of Luce and Daniel&#x2019;s first meeting until I wrote them. I knew there would be a moment when she would think she&#x2019;d arrived at the start of all her love, which would feel strangely hollow and lacking. When Luce finally arrives at the source&#x2014;like most elusive, long-sought goals&#x2014;it&#x2019;s not what she was expecting. By then her perspective has shifted so radically that a thousand other things matter more than the first moment she laid eyes on Daniel. But she still needed to get there, to realize how much she&#x2019;d grown. It&#x2019;s good to have ambitious goals in life, if only to be usefully disillusioned when you realize them.</p> <p> <strong>Q. Luce and Daniel have a love that transcends time, but throughout the series, Luce is still very much a normal modern girl, with normal insecurities and problems. How do you hope Luce&#x2019;s metamorphosis in <em>Rapture </em>might resonate with young women today?</strong><br> &nbsp;<br> <strong>A. </strong>Evolution of character is happening to all of us all the time. Whether we welcome or reject it determines the nature of our evolution, but nothing stops us from changing. All change is not progress&#x2014;Luce makes missteps throughout the series&#x2014;but there is one way that she is consistently admirable: She&#x2019;s open to change. Her metamorphosis at the end of <em>Rapture</em> did not surprise me. I don&#x2019;t mean I knew what was going to happen--I didn&#x2019;t. I mean she began in a place where she decided to open herself to the world, so it was only a matter of time before that openness would bring her to a place that was previously unimaginable to all of us.<br> &nbsp;<br> Young women today: Sometimes evolution sucks because it so inevitable. Surround yourself with those who support your changes, who like to watch you grow, who want to help you become the person you&#x2019;re always on your way to being. And don&#x2019;t be afraid to own your failures. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <strong>Q. Let&#x2019;s talk about Lucifer&#x2014;perhaps the most infamous of all angels in the Bible, and a major player in <em>Passion</em> and <em>Rapture</em>. In this series you&#x2019;ve played with the blurry boundaries between good and evil, and in Lucifer we see this idea personified. How did you go about characterizing Lucifer, and how did you approach thorny questions like his motivation for what he did? Did you base his character and actions off sources you&#x2019;ve previously mentioned, like <em>Paradise Lost</em>, or was his character entirely your own invention?</strong></p> <p> <strong>A. </strong>I write love stories. More specifically, I write love stories that slip love into the inception of a familiar myth or story. My first novel, <em>The Betrayal of Natalie Hargrove</em>, takes <em>Macbeth</em> and introduces thwarted lust into the backstory, so that unrequited love predates the fierce ambition of Shakespeare&#x2019;s narrative. In the <em>Fallen</em> series, we get to know Lucifer very well. The Lucifer we meet in <em>Paradise Lost</em> is motivated by pride. But from where does such extreme pride spring?&nbsp; <em>Rapture</em> proposes an answer.</p> <p> When love is impossible it creates a dangerous and violent world. We see this in characters from Jay Gatsby to Humbert Humbert to Quentin Compson to Romeo Montague. Characters are worlds. They have their own atmospheres.</p> <p> <strong>Q. What are you working on now? Will you revisit the angels from the <em>Fallen</em> series?</strong></p> <p> <strong>A. </strong>I&#x2019;m working on a new series that slips love into the origins of a beloved myth.&nbsp; It&#x2019;s challenging and invigorating to make a fresh start, like moving to another country and making all new friends. I hope they let me stay awhile.</p><p>LAUREN KATE is the internationally bestselling author of the FALLEN series, comprised of&nbsp;<i>Fallen, Torment, Passion, Rapture</i>,&nbsp;<i>Fallen in Love</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Unforgiven</i>; and&nbsp;<i>The Orphan's Song</i>.

The novel exemplifies &#x201c;sensation fiction&#x201d; in featuring a beautiful criminal heroine, an amateur detective, blackmail, arson, violence, and plenty of suspenseful action. To its contemporary readers, it also offered the thrill of uncovering blackmail and criminal violence within the homes of the upper class. The novel makes trenchant critiques of Victorian gender roles and social stereotypes, and it creates significant sympathy for the heroine, despite her criminal acts, as she suffers from the injustices of the &#x201c;marriage market&#x201d; and rebels against them. </p> <p> This Broadview edition includes a critical introduction and a broad selection of primary source material, including reproductions of the twenty-two woodcut illustrations from the <em>London Journal</em> serialization of the novel, extracts from two Victorian dramatizations of the work, satirical commentaries, and contemporary reviews. </p></p><p><p> <strong>Natalie M. Houston</strong> is an Assistant Professor of English at the University of Houston. </p><p> &#x201c;This impressive, scholarly new edition brings together a wealth of supplementary material, much of which is almost unobtainable elsewhere. Several fascinating appendices include contemporary parodies of the novel, extracts from stage versions, contemporary criticism and well-chosen extracts from Braddon&#x2019;s other work. Natalie Houston&#x2019;s scholarly introduction provides useful insights into Braddon&#x2019;s life and work. This edition will be invaluable to anyone studying or teaching the novel, or just reading it for enjoyment.&#x201d; &#x2015; Chris Willis, Birkbeck College </p> <p> &#x201c;This intelligent edition offers a wonderful introduction not just to Lady Audley&#x2019;s Secret, but to the whole publishing phenomenon of sensation fiction. By emphasizing questions of alterable identity, the new Victorian culture of information, and the relationship of fiction to other media, Natalie Houston compellingly brings home the connection of this novel with many important issues today.&#x201d; &#x2015; Kate Flint, Rutgers University </p></p><h2>The General and the Genius: Groves and Oppenheimer - The Unlikely Partnership that Built the Atom Bomb</h2><p><b>Two ambitious men. One historic mission.</b><br><br>With a blinding flash in the New Mexico desert in the summer of 1945, the world was changed forever. The bomb that ushered in the atomic age was the product of one of history's most improbable partnerships. <i>The General and the Genius</i> reveals how two extraordinary men pulled off the greatest scientific feat of the twentieth century. Leslie Richard Groves of the Army Corps of Engineers, who had made his name by building the Pentagon in record time and under budget, was made overlord of the impossibly vast scientific enterprise known as the Manhattan Project. His mission: to beat the Nazis to the atomic bomb. So he turned to the nation's preeminent theoretical physicist, J. Robert Oppenheimer&#x2014;the chain-smoking, martini-quaffing son of wealthy Jewish immigrants, whose background was riddled with communist associations&#x2014;Groves's opposite in nearly every respect. In their three-year collaboration, the iron-willed general and the visionary scientist led a brilliant team in a secret mountaintop lab and built the fearsome weapons that ended the war but introduced the human race to unimaginable new terrors. And at the heart of this most momentous work of World War II is the story of two extraordinary men&#x2014;the general and the genius.</p><p><b>James W. Kunetka</b> is a bestselling novelist and the author of two previous books about Los Alamos and the Manhattan Project. As a consultant at Los Alamos with top-secret clearance, he evaluated classified documents in the archives for their historical value. A retired associate vice president of the University of Texas, Mr. Kunetka lives in Austin.<br><b><i>Publisher's Weekly</i> Review: </b> <p></p>"Timed to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the Trinity Test, the detonation of the first atomic bomb, Kunetka shares the story of its development. Having previously written on the subject (1978's <i>City of Fire</i> and 1981's <i>Oppenheimer, Year of Risk</i>), Kunetka here uses original records and correspondence to produce a fast-paced recounting of the two and a half year Manhattan Project. He sets this narrative apart by focusing on the relationship between the two key leaders of the project: Gen. Leslie Richard "Dick" Groves, director of the Manhattan Project, and J. Robert Oppenheimer, director of the Los Alamos Laboratory. Groves was from a middle class family, authoritarian, brusque, and focused on his mission. Oppenheimer was wealthy, charismatic, liberal, and focused on academic understanding. Despite the tremendous pressures of war, these two very different men worked together in relative harmony. Kunetka highlights the unlikeliness of their positive relationship and attributes it to the qualities they shared: both were intelligent, self-aware, patriotic, and capable of prodigious amounts of work. He also simplifies the physics to be understandable to lay readers. This is an entertaining and informative account of a time of great tension, great discovery, and great accomplishment."<br></p><h2>Principles of the Philosophy of the Future (Hackett Classics)</h2><p>Includes an Introduction and selected bibliography.</p><p>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Mathematics Formative Assessment, Volume 1: 75 Practical Strategies for Linking Assessment, Instruction, and Learning</h2><p><p><b><i>Transform your mathematics instruction with this rich collection of formative assessment techniques</i></b></p> <br> <br> <p>Award-winning author Page Keeley and mathematics expert Cheryl Rose Tobey apply the successful format of Keeley&#x2019;s best-selling <i>Science Formative Assessment</i> to mathematics.

While the heart of the book focuses on the Civil War, Gienapp begins with a finely etched portrait of Lincoln's early life, from pioneer farm boy to politician and lawyer in Springfield, to his stunning election as sixteenth president of the United States. Students will see how Lincoln grew during his years in office, how he developed a keen aptitude for military strategy and displayed enormous skill in dealing with his generals, and how his war strategy evolved from a desire to preserve the Union to emancipation and total war. <br>Gienapp shows how Lincoln's early years influenced his skills as commander-in-chief and demonstrates that, throughout the stresses of the war years, Lincoln's basic character shone through: his good will and fundamental decency, his remarkable self-confidence matched with genuine humility, his immunity to the passions and hatreds the war spawned, his extraordinary patience, and his timeless devotion. <br>A former backwoodsman and country lawyer, Abraham Lincoln rose to become one of our greatest presidents. This biography offers a vivid account of Lincoln's dramatic ascension to the pinnacle of American history.<br></p><p>William E. Gienapp has taught at the University of California, Berkeley, The University of Wyoming and Harvard University, where he is professor of Harvard College. He is the author of The Origins of the Republican Party, 1852-1956 (1987), which received the Avery O. Craven Award from the organization of American Historians, and co-author of Nations of Nations, a U.S History textbook. A specialist on the Civil War era, he recently published a documentary collection on the war and Reconstruction and is currently writing a history of the Civil War.Harvard history professor Gienapp (The Origins of the Republican Party) devotes a mere 70 pages of his brief new biography to Abraham Lincoln's prepresidential life; in a volume that "synthesizes modern scholarship about Lincoln" with the author's own studies, the Civil War years rightfully get most of the attention. At 51, Lincoln was one of the youngest men to be elected president, and he was also the first Westerner. Something of an unknown to Republican Party power brokers back east, Lincoln didn't have time to prove himself viable before South Carolina seceded from the Union and the Civil War loomed. Gienapp's primary ambition is to show how the green, upstart president handled the four years of crisis that followed and how he became such an "extraordinary war leader." Throughout the book, he reveals Lincoln as a shrewd arbitrator of political factions, armies and perhaps most importantly rhetoric and propaganda. Likewise, Gienapp shows Lincoln the man: the father grieving over the death of a cherished son, the husband dealing with a moody, combustible wife. Gienapp seems to especially relish accounts of the harried Lincoln's savvy PR moves throughout the war, as when, in 1864, he threw a bone to Northern pacifists and expressed his willingness to engage in peace talks with the Confederacy. At the same time, Lincoln set out rigid preconditions for the talks that he knew Jefferson Davis never could accept. This is the Lincoln Gienapp gives us: astute, subtle, incisive and tragic. Illus. (Apr.) Forecast: This is a fine intro for new browsers through the Lincoln bookshelf, though David Herbert Donald's work remains the definitive bio to date.<p></p><p>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>C: A Reference Manual, 5th Edition</h2><p><p>This authoritative reference manual provides a complete description of the C language, the run-time libraries, and a style of C programming that emphasizes correctness, portability, and maintainability.

(Rollout and proudcts will appear in 1998.) Developed long-term vision in SDS and helped develop technology roadmaps. From 1995-96 as CTO Harbison set Tartan's technical direction. He defined and ran a new engineering organization and product development process that gave project managers more authority. He helped spearhead Tartan's long-term growth strategy by defining new products for C and Assembly programming on DSPs. Harbison managed the technical due diligence for TI merger. In 1992, he founded and directed the C/C++ Division, Tartan's first business unit and key to diversifying into commercial markets. Developed first PC-hosted products and first C++ product, for TI DSPs. Created a line of DSP math functions. Pioneered world-wide distribution channels using TI and 3rd parties. (Direct sales used elsewhere.)In 1990, Harbison founded a company, Pine Creek Software, funded by Digital Equipment Corp. to create a market for the Modula-3 programming language. Wrote the first Modula-3 textbook, exhibited at trade shows, wrote software, and published a newsletter. Still recognized as an authority, he was contracted by CRC in 1997 for a Modula-3 chapter in forthcoming Handbook of Object Technology.From 1982-1989, Harbison held various senior positions at Tartan, including Vice President. He led the software QA team &amp; developed company-wide QA policies (1989). He managed several technology groups (1985-89). He was the project manager for Tartan's first commercial product (1984), and program manager for a contract with IBM to develop compilers for their RT PC (precursor to RS/6000). He designed and led development of Tartan's debugger (AdaScope). He developed the C compiler front end, and other internal tools (1981-1984). From 1980-82 Harbison was part of the SPICE research project at Carnegie-Mellon, which evangelized the concept of a "personal workstation" before most companies thought it was feasible. From 1974-80, he helped to develop the Hydra object-oriented, multiprocessor operating system, whose concepts were later used in the Intel 432 microprocessor.</p></p><h2>Skills in Clinical Nursing</h2><p><p> <i>For use as a primary textbook in clinical nursing education programs, and as a reference for practicing nurses</i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>Help each student think like a nurse using a clear, consistent presentation of nursing skills<br> </b>Consistency and accessibility are essential to student success in the Fundamentals of Nursing course.

That volume first articulated the "transformative model" of mediation, which greatly humanized the vision of how the mediation process could help parties in conflict. In the past decade, the transformative model has proved itself and gained increasing acceptance. It is now being used in such diverse arenas as workplace, community, family, organizational, and public policy conflicts, among others. <p>In this new edition, the authors draw on a decade of work in theory development, training, practice, research, and assessment to present a thoroughly revised and updated account of the transformative model of mediation and its practical application, including</p> <ul> <li>a compelling description of how the field has moved toward increasing acceptance of the transformative model</li> <li>a new and clearer presentation of the theory and practices of transformative mediation, with many concrete examples</li> <li>a new case study that provides a vivid picture of the model in practice, with a commentary full of new information about how to use it effectively</li> <li>clarifications of common misconceptions about the model</li> <li>a vision for the future that shows how the model can coexist with other approaches and where the "market" for transformative mediation is emerging</li> </ul> This volume is a foundational resource on transformative practice, for both readers of the first edition and new readers - including mediators, facilitators, lawyers, administrators, human resource professionals, policymakers, and conflict resolution researchers and educators.

The first edition of <i>The Promise of Mediation</i> served as a stunning reminder of the potential of mediation to empower individuals and communities in conflict. I credit Bush and Folger with reminding the field of its core values. Since the first edition, they have worked tirelessly to support the development of a practice congruent with these values. I believe that their efforts have produced a new model of mediation, one that provides a unique role for the mediator�especially the community &#x2018;citizen mediator.&#x2019; When we use the transformative model, we&#x2019;re offering a form of help that no one else in society is offering to our fellow citizens.&#x201d;--Thomas Wahlrab, member, board of directors, National Association for Community Mediation, and coordinator, Dayton (Ohio) Mediation Center </p><p> "Being human is what human beings do. Yet our approaches to conflict analysis and resolution often dehumanize conflicts, by marginalizing emotions and avoiding discussion of painful histories. In this book, Bush and Folger help us re-imagine mediation within a relational framework where emotions and painful histories are essential features of&nbsp; the conflict transformation process. This framework not only focuses on the connection between people, but alos favors reflection on the parties' experiences, as human being. And by implication, mediators, as human beings, are encouraged to trust the parties in terms of their ability to move through the problems. Conflict is thus reframed as a contribution to the development of interaction, reather than a feature of life that needs 'management.' While this book contributes to our understanding of a model of mediation, it also humainzes conflict, and in the process celebrates what it means to be a human being."--Sara Cobb, director, Institute for Conflict Analysis and Resolution, George Mason University </p><p> &nbsp;</p>The Guide on the Transformative Mediation Process <p>Praise for The Promise of Mediation</p> <p>"The Promise of Mediation has been the single most significant influence on the modern ADR movement.

In <em>The Discovery of Grounded Theory, </em>Barney Glaser and Anselm Strauss address the equally Important enterprise of how the discovery of theory from data&#x2015;systematically obtained and analyzed in social research&#x2015;can be furthered. The discovery of theory from data&#x2015;grounded theory&#x2015;is a major task confronting sociology, for such a theory fits empirical situations, and is understandable to sociologists and laymen alike. Most important, it provides relevant predictions, explanations, interpretations, and applications.</p><p>In Part I of the book, "Generation Theory by Comparative Analysis," the authors present a strategy whereby sociologists can facilitate the discovery of grounded theory, both substantive and formal. This strategy involves the systematic choice and study of several comparison groups. In Part II, The Flexible Use of Data," the generation of theory from qualitative, especially documentary, and quantitative data Is considered. In Part III, "Implications of Grounded Theory," Glaser and Strauss examine the credibility of grounded theory.</p><p><em>The Discovery of Grounded Theory </em>is directed toward improving social scientists' capacity for generating theory that will be relevant to their research. While aimed primarily at sociologists, it will be useful to anyone Interested In studying social phenomena&#x2015;political, educational, economic, industrial&#x2015; especially If their studies are based on qualitative data.</p><p></p></p><p><p> <em>Barney G.

By reconstructing authentic, complex AI programs using state-of-the-art Common Lisp, the book teaches students and professionals how to build and debug robust practical programs, while demonstrating superior programming style and important AI concepts. The author strongly emphasizes the practical performance issues involved in writing real working programs of significant size. Chapters on troubleshooting and efficiency are included, along with a discussion of the fundamentals of object-oriented programming and a description of the main CLOS functions. This volume is an excellent text for a course on AI programming, a useful supplement for general AI courses and an indispensable reference for the professional programmer.</p></p><p>This is an overview of classical artificial intelligence (AI) programming via actual implementation of landmark systems (case studies). For the student interested in AI, <i>Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming</i> is an invaluable history lesson. Even the programmer who is relatively uninterested in AI will find value in the book's basic introduction to Lisp and case studies written in Lisp. But perhaps the book's best feature is its information on efficiency considerations in Lisp. <i>Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming</i> is worth purchasing for these discussions alone, which provide a wealth of useful guidelines for optimizing your code.By Peter Norvig</p><h2>Making Social Science Matter: Why Social Inquiry Fails and How it Can Succeed Again</h2><p>Making Social Science Matter presents an exciting new approach to social science, including theoretical argument, methodological guidelines, and examples of practical application.

He then developed a personal, positive philosophy that turned out to be orthodox Christianity. First published in 1908, when he was 35, this intellectual and spiritual autobiography combines simplicity with subtlety in a model apologetic for those who face the same materialism and anti-supernaturalism as the &#34;man at war with his times&#34;.</p><p>If G.K. Chesterton's <i>Orthodoxy: The Romance of Faith</i> is, as he called it, a "slovenly autobiography," then we need more slobs in the world. This quirky, slender book describes how Chesterton came to view orthodox Catholic Christianity as the way to satisfy his personal emotional needs, in a way that would also allow him to live happily in society. Chesterton argues that people in western society need a life of "practical romance, the combination of something that is strange with something that is secure. We need so to view the world as to combine an idea of wonder and an idea of welcome." Drawing on such figures as Fra Angelico, George Bernard Shaw, and St. Paul to make his points, Chesterton argues that submission to ecclesiastical authority is the way to achieve a good and balanced life. The whole book is written in a style that is as majestic and down-to-earth as C.S. Lewis at his best. The final chapter, called "Authority and the Adventurer," is especially persuasive. It's hard to imagine a reader who will not close the book believing, at least for the moment, that the Church will make you free. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>In the past few hundred years, some great Christian thinkers, pioneers, radicals and visionaries have penned works of literature that continue to influence Christians today.

Her films included Show Boat, The Snows of Kilimanjaro, The Barefoot Contessa, and On the Beach. But her life off the screen was every bit as fabulous as her film roles.<br> <br>Born poor in rural North Carolina, Gardner was given a Hollywood tryout thanks to a stunning photo of her displayed in a shop window. Not long after arriving in Hollywood, she caught the eye of Mickey Rooney, then America&#x2019;s #1 box-office draw. Rooney was a womanizer so notorious that even his mother warned Gardner about him. They married, but the marriage lasted only a year (&#x201c;my shortest husband and my biggest mistake&#x201d;). Ava then married band leader and clarinetist Artie Shaw, who would eventually marry eight times, but that marriage, too, lasted only about a year (&#x201c;he was a dominating son of a bitch . . . always putting me down&#x201d;). She carried on a passionate affair with Howard Hughes but didn&#x2019;t love him, she said. Her third marriage was a tempestuous one to Frank Sinatra (&#x201c;We were fighting all the time. Fighting and boozing. It was madness. . . . But he was good in the feathers&#x201d;).<br> <br>Faithfully recording Ava&#x2019;s reminiscences in this book, Peter Evans describes their late-night conver�sations when Ava, having had something to drink and unable to sleep, was at her most candid. So candid, in fact, that when she read her own words, she backed out and halted the book. Only now, years after her death, could this frank and revealing memoir be published. <br> <br>&#x201c;If I get into this stuff, oh, honey, have you got something coming,&#x201d; Ava told Evans. Ava Gardner: The Secret Conversations is the stunning story of a legendary star&#x2019;s public and private lives.</p><p>Peter Evans was a columnist and foreign correspondent with the <i>Daily Express</i> (UK), and wrote for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> and <i>Vogue</i>, as well as every major newspaper in Britain.

Buckley, Jr. remembers&#x2014;as only he could&#x2014;the towering figures of the twentieth century in a brilliant and emotionally powerful collection, compiled by acclaimed Fox News correspondent James Rosen.</b><br><br>In a half century on the national stage, William F. Buckley, Jr. achieved unique stature as a writer, a celebrity, and the undisputed godfather of modern American conservatism. He kept company with the best and brightest, the sultry and powerful. Ronald Reagan pronounced WFB &#x201c;perhaps the most influential journalist and intellectual in our era,&#x201d; and his jet-setting life was a who&#x2019;s who of high society, fame, and fortune. <br><br>Among all his distinctions, which include founding the conservative magazine <i>National Review</i> and hosting the long-running talk show <i>Firing Line</i>, Buckley was also a master of that most elusive art form: the eulogy. He drew on his unrivaled gifts to mourn, celebrate, or seek mercy for the men and women who touched his life and the nation. <br><br>Now, for the first time, WFB&#x2019;s sweeping judgments of the great figures of his time&#x2014;presidents and prime ministers, celebrities and scoundrels, intellectuals and guitar gods&#x2014;are collected in one place. <i>A Torch Kept Lit</i> presents more than fifty of Buckley&#x2019;s best eulogies, drawing on his personal memories and private correspondences and using a novelist&#x2019;s touch to conjure his subjects as he knew them. We are reintroduced, through Buckley&#x2019;s eyes, to the likes of Winston Churchill and Ronald Reagan, Elvis Presley and John Lennon, Truman Capote and Martin Luther King, Jr.<br><br>Curated by Fox News chief Washington correspondent James Rosen, a Buckley prot�g� and frequent contributor to<i> National Review</i>, this volumes sheds light on a tumultuous period in American history&#x2014;from World War II to Watergate, the &#x201c;death&#x201d; of God to the Grateful Dead&#x2014;as told in the inimitable voice of one of our most elegant literary stylists.William F. Buckley, Jr. is back&#x2014;just when we need him most.</p><p>As chief Washington correspondent for Fox News, <b>James Rosen</b> has covered the White House and State Department beats and reported from Capitol Hill, the Pentagon, the Supreme Court, nearly all fifty states, and forty foreign countries across five continents. Rosen&#x2019;s articles and essays have appeared in the N<i>ew York Times</i>, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, the<i> Washington Post</i>, <i>Harper&#x2019;s</i>, <i>The Atlantic</i>, <i>National Review</i>, and <i>Playboy</i>, among many other periodicals. He is the author of <i>The Strong Man: John Mitchelland the Secrets of Watergate</i> and <i>Cheney One on One</i>.<br><br><i>National Review</i> is a semimonthly magazine founded by author <b>William F. Buckley</b>, JR. in 1955 and is based in New York City. It is America&#x2019;s most widely read and influential magazine and website for conservative news, commentary, and opinion.Dwight Eisenhower<br><br>(1890&#x2013;�1969)<br><br>From the start, William F. Buckley, Jr., and National Review exhibited an oppositional temperament, as captured in the magazine&#x2019;s opening declaration that it &#x201c;stands athwart history, yelling Stop.&#x201d; But it was also clear from the outset that those whom WFB intended to Stop were not just liberals but their handmaidens in the Republican Party, the RINOs of the day whose capitulations to liberals, in and out of Congress, contributed to the left&#x2019;s cultural hegemony. Chief among WFB&#x2019;s Republican targets at that time was the much-�revered Dwight D. Eisenhower. Even before National Review launched&#x2014;�in November 1955, roughly midway through Ike&#x2019;s presidency&#x2014;�Buckley had begun registering his disappointment with the former Supreme Allied Commander of World War II. In some of his earliest published writing, WFB lamented that there existed between the two major parties an &#x201c;ephemeral battle line dividing two almost identical streams of superficial thought,&#x201d; that only &#x201c;trivia&#x201d; separated &#x201c;the 1952 Republican from the 1952 Democrat.&#x201d; By June 1955, in an article titled &#x201c;The Liberal Mind,&#x201d; published in Facts Forum News, Buckley was likening Ike to the sitting Soviet premier:<br><br>[W]e know more about the workings of the mind of Nikolai Bulganin than we know about the workings of the mind of Dwight Eisenhower. . . . [T]he life of Bulganin makes sense in a way that the life of Eisenhower does not.<br><br>NR&#x2019;s debut issue also lamented the growth of &#x201c;a gigantic, parasitic bureaucracy.&#x201d; A decade later, when WFB ran for mayor of New York City, the Republican target of the oppositional temperament would be John V. Lindsay&#x2014;�but even then, the betrayal of Eisenhower weighed heavily on Buckley, as recorded in The Unmaking of a Mayor (1966):<br><br>Even under the moderate Eisenhower&#x2014;�the Republican exemplar, according to the rules of prevailing opinion&#x2014;�the registration figures continued to polarize, as they had during the preceding two decades. Two years before the good general came into office, the national registration figures were 45 percent to 33 percent in favor of the Democrats, according to Dr. Gallup. When he left the pulpit, eight years later, the infidels had in fact increased, the figures having separated to 46 percent Democrats and 30 percent Republicans.<br><br>What did emerge in the post-�Eisenhower years among Republicans was a hunger for orthodoxy, for an intellectual discipline in the formulation of policy. It was fueled in part by the long diet of blandness that had produced a body lacking in tone and coordination. . . . <br><br>WFB&#x2019;s eulogy was prepared in advance as Eisenhower lay dying.<br><br>The accomplishments of Dwight Eisenhower will be copiously recorded now that he is gone, that being the tradition, and tradition being what one has come to associate with General Eisenhower, who comes to us even now as a memory out of the remote past. During his lifetime he had his detractors. There are those who oppose Dwight Eisenhower because he was the man who defeated Adlai Stevenson. In their judgment it was profanation for anyone to stand in the way of Adlai Stevenson. And so, when Eisenhower was inaugurated, they took up, and forever after maintained, a jeremiad on America the theme of which was: America is a horrible country because a banal and boring general with not an idea in his head gets to beat a scintillating intellectual who is in tune with the future. These gentry did President Eisenhower a certain amount of harm, and in later years they took to referring routinely to his tenure as &#x201c;boring,&#x201d; &#x201c;lacking in ideals,&#x201d; and &#x201c;styleless.&#x201d;<br><br>Their criticisms never actually took hold. America wanted Eisenhower in preference to Stevenson; and however keenly we felt the death of Stevenson, it wasn&#x2019;t&#x2014;�speaking for the majority&#x2014;�because we had failed to confer the presidency upon him. Stevenson was born to be defeated for the presidency.<br><br>Among the critics of Mr. Eisenhower also from the liberal end of the world are a few who reckoned him as quite different from what it is generally supposed that he was. There are those&#x2014;�one thinks of the singularly acute Mr. Murray Kempton, who all along has led that particular pack&#x2014;�who saw Mr. Eisenhower as perhaps the most highly efficient political animal ever born in the United States. They believe that his aspect of indifference to practical political matters was one of the most successful dissimulations in political history. He had, they maintain, the most accomplished sense of political danger that any man ever developed, and he always knew&#x2014;�they maintain&#x2014;�how to defend himself against the ravages of political decisiveness by a) setting up another guy, who would easily fall victim; and b) appearing to be innocently disinterested in the grinding of political gears.<br><br>The record is certainly there, that over a period of a dozen years, it was, somehow, always somebody else who stood between him and the tough decisions: a Sherman Adams, a Richard Nixon, a CIA. General Eisenhower never really developed any mass opposition. His critics were either formalistic (the Democratic Party); or personal&#x2014;�men who held him responsible not for what he did, but for what he failed to do.<br><br>It is I think this category of critics of the General which is the most interesting. Not the liberals, but the conservatives. It is hardly a surprise that liberals would have faulted Eisenhower&#x2019;s performance as president, they having so hotly desired the election of another man. But the conservatives, or at least many of them, were genuinely disappointed that he let the federal government grow at a rate no domesticated Democrat could reasonably have exceeded. Disappointed by his failure to take decisive action against the Soviet Union notwithstanding unique historical opportunities, as for instance in Hungary, Egypt, and Cuba. Disappointed by his dismal unconcern with the philosophy of conservatism (of which he was a purely intuitive disciple) at a point in the evolution of America when a few conservative philosophers at his side might have accomplished more for the ends he sought to serve than the battery of sycophantic (and opportunistic) big businessmen with whom he loved to while away the hours.<br><br>The critique of General Eisenhower from the right will perhaps be the most interesting historical critique (to use the Army term): and one somehow feels that the General, retired from office, had an inkling of this. Never was he so adamantly and philosophically conservative as when he last addressed the nation, via the Republican Convention at Miami Beach, a fortnight ago.<br><br>Meanwhile we are left to mourn the (imminent&#x2014;�Editors: Please supply if necessary) passing of an extraordinary man, a genius of personal charm, a public servant manifestly infected with a lifetime case of patriotism. His country requited his services. No honor was unpaid to him. If he was, somehow at the margin deficient, it was because the country did not rise to ask of him the performance of a thunderbolt. He gave what he was asked to give. And he leaves us (or &#x201c;will leave&#x201d;) if not exactly bereft, lonely; lonely for the quintessential American.<br><br>END.<br><br>John F. Kennedy<br><br>(1917&#x2013;�1963)<br><br>As early as 1957, WFB described John F. Kennedy as an &#x201c;ideological wraith,&#x201d; marveling at how the junior senator from Massachusetts had mastered &#x201c;the art of voting Liberal and appearing conservative.&#x201d; When, a year later, Senator Kennedy proposed that the United States adopt an &#x201c;underdog&#x201d; strategy with the Soviet Union, pursuing diplomacy through disarmament, NR recoiled in &#x201c;utter amazement&#x201d;:<br><br>[W]e suppose Senator Kennedy was merely making a campaign speech. We hope his dreams of reducing &#x201c;the [missile] gap&#x201d; by reliance on calls for disarmament are not unduly disturbed by memories of a book he once wrote. The title was Why England Slept [1940].<br><br>During the 1960 election, WFB again scored JFK for weakness on foreign policy, anticipating the themes later to inform David Halberstam&#x2019;s The Best and the Brightest (1972): &#x201c;The most educated men in our midst and the most highly-�trained&#x2014;�and those who trained the Kennedys&#x2014;�have not been understanding the march of history, in which [Fidel] Castro is a minor player, though at the moment great shafts of light converge upon him and give him a spectacular brilliance.&#x201d; After the Bay of Pigs, NR condemned Kennedy&#x2019;s &#x201c;contemptible&#x201d; inaction, arguing that it &#x201c;left . . . 700 brave Cubans to die, and 6 million others to live in slavery.&#x201d; Nor did Buckley believe the USSR had &#x201c;blinked&#x201d; in the Cuban Missile Crisis: &#x201c;President John F. Kennedy, 35th president of the United States, has formally given our bitterest enemy a pledge that we will enforce the nonenforcement of the Monroe Doctrine! . . . How can it be maintained that we have won a great victory when Khrushchev is, in October, ahead of where he was in May?&#x201d;<br><br>Kennedy took note of his erudite critic. Upon receiving his honorary degree from Yale in June 1962, the president told the graduates he was &#x201c;particularly glad to become a Yale man because as I think about my troubles, I find that a lot of them have come from other Yale men . . . not to mention William F. Buckley, Jr., of the class of 1950.&#x201d;<br><br>With JFK&#x2019;s death, WFB found himself, rhetorically, in a tight spot: He had to acknowledge the intense mourning, yet he also felt compelled to remind his readers that JFK was a real, and controversial, person and that the conservative challenge to the Kennedy program needed, perforce, to be carried to his successor. WFB penned two JFK eulogies, the first somewhat rushed, presumably produced on tight deadline, and the second longer, more thoughtful&#x2014;�and more barbed.<br><br>&#x201c;J.F.K., 1917&#x2013;�1963&#x201d;<br><br>National Review, December 10, 1963.<br><br>The grief was spontaneous and, in most cases, wholly sincere. Not because Mr. Kennedy&#x2019;s policies were so universally beloved, but because he was a man so intensely charming, whose personal vigor and robust enjoyment of life so invigorated almost all who beheld him. The metabolism of the whole nation rose on account of the fairyland quality of the First Family. After all, no divine typecaster could have done better than to get JFK to play JFK, Jackie to play the First Lady, and the children to play themselves.<br><br>The assassination of President Kennedy was the act presumably of a madman, heir to the madmen who killed Lincoln and McKinley and, for that matter, Christ, reminding us that the beasts are always with us, and that they continue to play decisive roles in history, and in human affairs.<br><br>Even his most adamant political opponents acknowledged the personal courage Mr. Kennedy showed during his young and dazzling lifetime. Now, no doubt, he would desire that his countrymen also act heroically, by enduring their grief; and by demonstrating to his bereaved family not only their compassion, but also their fortitude.<br><br>&#x201c;The Morning After&#x201d;<br><br>National Review, December 17, 1963.<br><br>Norman Mailer, reviewing Victor Lasky&#x2019;s book on John Kennedy several weeks ago for the New York Herald Tribune, remarked that Kennedy&#x2019;s political genius rested in his apprehension of the main point in American politics towards the close of the &#x2019;50s, namely, that the American people were ready, in Mailer&#x2019;s words, to turn away from the father image (Eisenhower), and accept as ruler someone cast in the role of the young hero; someone in the Hollywood image, as Mailer put it.<br><br>Mailer seems to have been right, as he very often is. What happened, two and one-�half weeks ago, was the Morte d&#x2019;Arthur. The grief was that of a nation that had lost a young king, a young king whose own fairyland rise to power recapitulated the national experience; whose personal radiance warmed the whole nation&#x2014;�and whose great failures were charitably disregarded, for were we not, really, forgiving ourselves? And are we not, really, grieving for ourselves? &#x201c;A part of me has gone with him,&#x201d; one orator said, and a great chorus responded to the theme: and they are all exactly correct, they have lost a part of themselves. Much of America, the intelligentsia especially, succeeded in anthropomorphizing itself in the image of John Kennedy, whereon it had to follow that when he lay bleeding, they lay bleeding; and that the great ache, the anxiety expressed so effusively, lay in the numbing realization that though their king was dead, they were still alive, and would have to learn again to act for themselves. And, God help us, to think for themselves.<br><br>For it gives one the grues. The assassination itself, yes, obviously. We know what death is, and what evil is in the twentieth century. We live with violence, and apocalypse is camped just over the horizon. We have lived with violent endings, for individuals, and for nations, and for whole races. We know the unyielding finality of death, and one&#x2019;s helplessness before recurrent acts of individual and collective depravity. But what is this other thing that seems to be going on? Pay the man all the many compliments to which he is entitled, and sing the praises he is due. But not all this, no indeed; and for the reason, first among the others, that it tends to undermine those qualities in national life that John Kennedy at his best exemplified: courage, dignity, fortitude, toughmindedness, independence.<br><br>The rhetoric has gone quite out of control. The symbol of our emotional, if not neurotic excess, is the Eternal Flame at Arlington, a few hundred yards from the shrines we built to the memories of George Washington (86 years after he died), Thomas Jefferson (117 years), and Abraham Lincoln (57 years); who have no eternal flames. The lovely and tormented Mrs. Kennedy needs a gentle hand lest in her understandable grief, she give the air of the Pharaoh, specifying his own magnitude.<br><br>John F. Kennedy lived a life of tough controversy, and while it is correct that an individual&#x2019;s weaknesses should be buried with him, it is not ever possible to bury the public issues on which a public figure committed himself. Mr. Kennedy told us the fight would last beyond his lifetime; and his successor has pledged himself on the same side of those policies. It is sobering to recall that there was great dissension, left and right, in respect of John Kennedy&#x2019;s policies, right up until the moment he died. The issue of Time magazine dated the awful day of the assassination carried, for instance, the news of a growing campus &#x201c;disenchantment&#x201d; with President Kennedy&#x2019;s policies, &#x201c;now spread far and wide.&#x201d; &#x201c;At conservative Georgia Tech,&#x201d; said Time, &#x201c;the complaint is that &#x2018;he&#x2019;s interfering with my personal life&#x2019; through Big Government. At liberal Reed, where &#x2018;he doesn&#x2019;t inspire respect as Stevenson did,&#x2019; the gripe is Kennedy&#x2019;s caution on the civil rights bill. At exuberant Wisconsin, &#x2018;he&#x2019;s liked in a negative way,&#x2019; faulted for lack of political conviction.&#x201d; The restlessness, as we see, was not partisan, not only from the Right.<br><br>Are we now being emotionally stampeded into believing that Kennedy was the incarnation, and that respect for him requires that we treat his program like the laws of the Medes and the Persians? What we need is a period of dignified mourning for a graceful human being who passed through our midst with style and energy, a mourning more intense in virtue of the treachery of his end; but less intense than that which degenerates into abject pity for ourselves, or that asks that we place our personal grief above the best interests of our country as we understand them; which interests many people thought of as calling for the retirement of Mr. Kennedy from public life one year from now. Jack Kennedy wouldn&#x2019;t want a caterwauling public besotted by its own tears for its own self, or accepting his program for sentimentality&#x2019;s sake. He asked us to keep the torch lit. And that means work, each one o...</p><h2>The Lost Island: A Gideon Crew Novel (Gideon Crew Series, 3)</h2><p>Gideon Crew--brilliant scientist, master thief--is living on borrowed time.

His friends increasingly behave like adults, while Thwaites still lives at home, "stuck in a big, dark hole." Luckily, a research grant offers the perfect out: a chance to take a holiday from the complications of being human&#x2014;by transforming himself into a goat. What ensues is a hilarious and surreal journey through engineering, design, and psychology, as Thwaites interviews neuroscientists, animal behaviorists, prosthetists, goat sanctuary workers, and goatherds.<br><br>From this, he builds a goat exoskeleton&#x2014;artificial legs, helmet, chest protector, raincoat from his mum, and a prosthetic goat stomach to digest grass (with help from a pressure cooker and campfire)&#x2014;before setting off across the Alps on four legs with a herd of his fellow creatures.

Ultimately, it's about the nature of the human condition, and the strange, sometimes glorious lengths to which people go in attempt to escape it." -Hyperallergic<br><br>"Thwaites writes with a puppyish humour and an unquenchable enthusiasm. His book is beautifully designed, with thick, glossy paper and loads of colour photographs of a man in a goat costume clambering over alpine rocks." -Daily Mail<br><br>"Thwaites is an artist with an engineer's soul, and he approached becoming a goat through the lens of problem-solving..Rethinking who we are; dreaming up new ways of living; taking ourselves apart to build ourselves back up--for human beings, these activities are natural. They are our never-ending hunt." -The New Yorker<br><br>"Thwaites is a lovely writer with a scientific bent and loads of curiosity." -Toronto Star<br><br>"The book is full of wonderful photographs of the author in goat mode, including at his ultimate destination among a farmer's herd in Switzerland. This part of the book is riveting, not least because it shows how hard it is to be a goat (or any non-human animal). A scene where the author mistakenly and awkwardly climbs to the top of a hill, putting himself higher than the established, aggressive male goats of the mob, is spellbinding." -The Australian<br><br>"The book is a charming, humorous, and exceedingly thorough account of one man's attempt to use science and technology to take mindfulness woo-woo to its most absurd yet logical conclusion." -Vogue.com</p><h2>God&#39;s Hand on America: Divine Providence in the Modern Era</h2><p><b>The national radio host and bestselling author of <i>The American Miracle</i> reveals the happy accidents, outrageous coincidences, and flat-out miracles that continue to shape America&#x2019;s destiny.</b><br><br> <b>&#x201c;The book isn't just inspiring; it reignites faith in God and the country upon which He has so richly dispensed his blessings.&#x201d;&#x2014;Ben Shapiro, The Daily Wire</b><br><br> <b>Has God withdrawn his special blessing from the United States?</b> Americans ponder that painful question in troubled times, as we did during the devastation of the Civil War and after the assassinations of the &#x2019;60s, and as we do in our present polarization.

Holly Barker sat next to him in the copilot&#x2019;s seat. &#x201c;Very nice,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; Stone replied, and taxied to the ramp, where a rental car was waiting for them. He transferred their luggage to the car, and Stone went inside and made arrangements for regular hangar space. Back in the car, he drove through the automatic gate.</p><p>&#x201c;Excited?&#x201d; Holly asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I guess so, yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If I had just bought a new house, sight unseen, I&#x2019;d be terrified.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not exactly sight unseen,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve visited there a few times. It was owned by Ed Eagle&#x2019;s wife&#x2019;s sister.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are we going to have a bed to sleep in?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We are. I bought it substantially furnished.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What does that mean?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to find out in about twenty minutes,&#x201d; he said, turning onto the Santa Fe bypass. Twenty minutes later they turned off the main highway at the Tesuque exit.</p><p>&#x201c;What street is it on?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This one&#x2014;Tesuque Village Road.&#x201d; They passed the Tesuque Village Market, and a quarter mile later, Stone turned into a drive and reached out his window to enter the gate code into the keypad. The gate slid silently open, and they drove up a fairly long drive and parked in front of the house.</p><p>&#x201c;From here, it looks like every other house in Santa Fe,&#x201d; Holly said.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s true, all Santa Fe houses look a little alike&#x2014;it&#x2019;s the architectural style and the mock adobe finish.&#x201d; He unloaded their luggage, carried it to the front door, and saw that the key was in the lock, as promised. They entered a long hallway and found a large living room on their right. The big pictures that had hung over the fireplaces at either end were gone. Otherwise, things seemed as he remembered them.</p><p>He gave Holly the tour of the kitchen, dining room, and his study, then led her to the master suite and showed her her bath and dressing room, where he left her luggage, then he took her into the bedroom. &#x201c;Look,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;a bed to sleep in.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Now?&#x201d; Holly asked mischievously.</p><p>&#x201c;Later. Unpack.&#x201d; He found his own bath and dressing room and unpacked his things, and they met in the study for drinks.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank God she left liquor,&#x201d; Holly said, sipping her bourbon.</p><p>They had hardly sat down in the comfortable leather chairs when the phone rang. &#x201c;I expect that&#x2019;s for the previous owner,&#x201d; Stone said, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;d better answer it.&#x201d; He pressed the speaker button. &#x201c;Hello?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Stone Barrington?&#x201d; a woman&#x2019;s voice asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This is the White House operator. Will you accept a call from President Lee?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Which President Lee?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I beg your pardon, the former President.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stone?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Will, how are you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Very well, thank you. How&#x2019;s the new house?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I moved in half an hour ago. How the hell did you find me here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you know? The White House operators can find anybody.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s the other President Lee?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thriving.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And William Henry the Fifth?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rambunctious. I wanted to invite you to something in Santa Fe tomorrow evening&#x2014;a fund-raiser, actually, but never mind that. It&#x2019;s dinner at the home of friends, followed by an evening at the Santa Fe Opera&#x2014;La boh�me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sounds wonderful, we&#x2019;d love to.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, yes, and give Holly my best.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, Mr. President,&#x201d; Holly said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the only person at the White House who will talk to me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not talking to you, I&#x2019;m talking to Stone. We all have orders from the commander in chief not to speak to you.&#x201d;</p><p>Holly sighed. &#x201c;Yes, I know.&#x201d; President Kate Lee had told her to take two weeks off and not to call the office, just to have fun. She had gone to New York to see Stone, but then he had bought the house and they had flown west to see it.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d love to come,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my favorite opera.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s everybody&#x2019;s favorite opera,&#x201d; Will replied. &#x201c;And you and I will have to find a private moment during the evening. There&#x2019;s something I need to talk to you about.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll look forward to it,&#x201d; Stone said.</p><p>&#x201c;Six o&#x2019;clock for drinks, followed by dinner. The opera begins at nine&#x2014;sundown.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;See you then,&#x201d; Stone said, then hung up.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m annoyed,&#x201d; Holly said. &#x201c;The White House will talk to you, but not to me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s because Kate knows you well enough to know that given an inch of access, you&#x2019;d take a mile. It would be as though you weren&#x2019;t on vacation at all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m unaccustomed to vacations,&#x201d; Holly replied. She was the national security advisor to the President and, as such, chaired the National Security Council. &#x201c;And there&#x2019;s no telling what those people are screwing up in my absence. I&#x2019;ll probably return to find that the nation is at war.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Remember, you chose many of those people. They&#x2019;re perfectly capable of running the council in your absence.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not what a girl wants to hear,&#x201d; she said moodily.</p><p>&#x201c;I think what you need is another drink,&#x201d; Stone said, picking up the bottle and refreshing her glass.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a mind reader.&#x201d; She took a gulp. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m hungry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s because it&#x2019;s two hours later in New York. Let me see what I can find.&#x201d; He went into the kitchen and found the refrigerator well stocked and returned with some cheese, crackers, and salami.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s better,&#x201d; Holly said. &#x201c;What are we doing for dinner?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll go up to the Market. It&#x2019;s a grocery, a restaurant, a pizzeria, a bakery, and, not least, a bar.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Everything we need for survival,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>Stone saw an envelope on his chairside table, addressed to him, and he opened it and read it aloud.</p><p>Dear Stone,</p><p>Welcome to your new home! Everything you see in the house is now yours. My L.A. house is already furnished, so all I took with me were my clothes and a few pictures. You&#x2019;ll have fun shopping for replacements. I&#x2019;ve attached a list of numbers for the best restaurants, the maid and cook, the gardener, a handyman, and others you might need. By the way, the hot tub is set to 100 degrees. Feel free to call for advice, and enjoy yourself!</p><p>Gala</p><p>&#x201c;That was sweet of her,&#x201d; Holly said. &#x201c;I like the sound of the hot tub.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then let&#x2019;s go find it,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;Bring your drink.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2</p><p>Stone and Holly found the house with his rental-car GPS; it was big, set into a hillside, and had quite a lot of guest parking. He found a spot and they walked toward the front door. A figure stepped out of the darkness: &#x201c;Mr. Barrington?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>The man showed him a badge. &#x201c;Secret Service. May I see some ID, please?&#x201d;</p><p>Stone showed him his New York driver&#x2019;s license.</p><p>&#x201c;Got anything federal-issued?&#x201d;</p><p>Stone showed him his pilot&#x2019;s license.</p><p>&#x201c;This way, please. Just you, not the lady.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Holly, will you go ahead inside? I&#x2019;ll join you shortly.&#x201d;</p><p>Holly climbed the steps, rang the bell, and was admitted. The agent led Stone to a large black SUV and rapped on the window. The door opened, and he motioned for Stone to get in.</p><p>&#x201c;Evening, Stone,&#x201d; Will Lee said, putting aside his New York Times. &#x201c;How are you?&#x201d; The agent closed the door, and the only sound Stone could hear was the air-conditioning.</p><p>&#x201c;Very well, Will.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Forgive me for ambushing you, but once we&#x2019;re inside, everyone will be watching.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d;</p><p>Will turned his body more toward Stone. &#x201c;I want to tell you a story, some of which you&#x2019;ll already know about.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Would you like a drink? We have Knob Creek.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure, thanks.&#x201d;</p><p>Will opened a compartment in front of them and extracted two glasses, some ice, and a bottle of the bourbon and poured them both one. &#x201c;Happier days,&#x201d; Will said.</p><p>&#x201c;Are these not happy ones?&#x201d; Stone asked, taking a swig.</p><p>&#x201c;Think of this as the first day of the election season,&#x201d; Will said, &#x201c;though we have a long way to go. The election season is never happy, just frenetic, and often depressing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I suppose you&#x2019;re right. What&#x2019;s the story?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It begins on a December day in Washington more than ten years ago. We were flying down to Georgia for Christmas, so we left our house in Georgetown and drove up to Silver Spring Airport, where we kept our airplane, at that time a new Piper Mirage. As I was doing my preflight, a marine helicopter set down next to us, and a young officer got out and told me that the vice president would like us to join him and his wife for breakfast at Camp David.</p><p>&#x201c;We arrived there and met Joe and Sue Adams, and after some small talk, Joe got serious. He told us that they had just spent a few days in New York, shopping and going to the theater. There was more to it, though&#x2014;Joe had had some medical tests, most of them in their suite at the Waldorf, and the results were troubling.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone nodded and had another sip of his drink.</p><p>So did Will. &#x201c;He told us, in the strictest confidence, that he had been diagnosed as being in the early stages of Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease, and that he hadn&#x2019;t told anybody else.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I never knew that,&#x201d; Stone said.</p><p>&#x201c;No one did, for a while. Remember, this was eleven months before the election, and the President couldn&#x2019;t run again. Joe was everybody&#x2019;s favorite for the nomination and the election.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That, I remember.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Joe told me that I was his personal choice for President, and he wanted me to announce almost immediately.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A big surprise.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;An enormous shock. I&#x2019;d given thought to running, but I didn&#x2019;t expect to do that for another eight years. Joe said that he would announce in another month or so that he would not be a candidate, but he didn&#x2019;t want anyone to know why. He was giving me a heads-up to give me time to get a team together for an announcement of my own.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That was very good of him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He knew that George Kiel, the minority leader in the Senate at the time, would jump right in, and that he, being better known than I, would be the immediate favorite. Anyway, we went back to our airplane, flew home, and I talked with my folks about it. They were all for a run, and eventually, as you know, I came around. Something odd happened, though, while we were still at the homeplace. Kate received a letter there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why was that odd?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because no mail had ever been addressed to her at my folks&#x2019; house. She borrowed the car, disappeared for about four hours, then returned. She said it was business, and I knew better than to ask any more. She was deputy director for intelligence at the CIA at the time.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone nodded. &#x201c;Did you ever find out where she went?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, but not until after the election. The letter was from a man named Ed Rawls. Does that ring a bell?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course&#x2014;a CIA mole for the Russians. He went to prison for it, and you later pardoned him. He lives near my house in Maine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right. At that time he was in the Atlanta federal prison. Kate had been responsible for exposing him, and she went to see him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because he alluded to Joe Adams&#x2019;s illness in the letter.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone sat up straight. &#x201c;But you had only learned about it that morning, right? And you and Kate were supposed to be the only ones who knew.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right again. You can see why she went to see him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I guess I can. How the hell could somebody in a federal prison know about this almost as soon as you did?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We never learned how he knew, but Ed was a brilliant intelligence agent, and he knew an awful lot of people, even if most of them weren&#x2019;t speaking to him anymore.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I guess not. Why did he want to see Kate?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because he wanted a presidential pardon, and he figured that if he helped get me elected, I might give him one.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That must have seemed pretty breathtaking.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It certainly took mine away when I finally heard about it. So, let&#x2019;s skip ahead a few months: I got the nomination, largely because Joe Adams called in some favors that helped us swing the California delegation at the last moment.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I remember. I was at the convention, and it was a squeaker.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right. I was losing the battle for the nomination because I had sworn to accept the recommendations of a study committee on whether to close a huge base in California. George Kiel had made the same pledge, but he told a lot of California delegates that he would renege on that promise if elected, and keep the base open. Joe managed to find out that the committee was going to recommend that the base remain open, so George&#x2019;s promise became meaningless.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;d Adams find out about the committee report?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ed Rawls found out and told Joe.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did you know about this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not at the time. All I knew was that everybody, including myself, wanted me to take George&#x2019;s offer to run with him on the ticket&#x2014;everybody but Joe Adams. He urged me to turn down George&#x2019;s offer and go for the nomination, but he wouldn&#x2019;t tell me why. I took his advice. Then word somehow got out that the base would not be closed. Most of George&#x2019;s delegates from California swung to me, and I got the nomination.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And, in due course, the presidency.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All because of inside information from a traitor to his country?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right, though I didn&#x2019;t know it for a long time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wait a minute,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;A while after you were nominated, the President had a stroke and died a few days later.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Correct.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And the vice president, Joe Adams, became President.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Correct again.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But he had Alzheimer&#x2019;s? And you knew that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I did. I had a very difficult time with the decision, but for a lot of reasons I kept my mouth shut, and Joe served out the term with distinction.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I never heard any rumors.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Few people did, because Ed Rawls had a hand in keeping Joe&#x2019;s secret from becoming public.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone sucked in a breath. &#x201c;And when did you find out about that, Will?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yesterday.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who told you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Joe Adams.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3</p><p>Stone sat back in his seat. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if you knew this, but I know Ed Rawls from Islesboro, where my Maine house is. We sort of worked together in solving a series of murders on the island.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know that,&#x201d; Will said, &#x201c;but that could actually be helpful in all this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All what? Let&#x2019;s get back to your story.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did you know that Ed Rawls was Kate&#x2019;s mentor at the Agency?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I may have read that somewhere at the time she exposed him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They were very close, and she was devastated when she found out what he&#x2019;d been doing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What, exactly, had Ed been doing?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He got caught in a honey trap&#x2014;photographs and all&#x2014;and the honey turned out to be a Soviet agent. He was near retirement, and the Soviets blackmailed him into giving them CIA secrets. Ed was smart enough not to give them anything damaging, but they kept a close rein on him, and one evening when two of our people who had become suspicious were following him, they rumbled his Soviet watchers, shots were exchanged, and our two people died. That, in the end, is what sent Ed to prison, even though he had no knowledge of either the Soviets or Americans following him. Except for that, he might never have been prosecuted.

It is the basis of our understanding of atoms, radiation, and so much else, from elementary particles and basic forces to the behavior of materials. But for a century it has also been the problem child of science: it has been plagued by intense disagreements between its inventors, strange paradoxes, and implications that seem like the stuff of fantasy. Whether it's Schr�dinger's cat--a creature that is simultaneously dead and alive--or a belief that the world does not exist independently of our observations of it, quantum theory challenges our fundamental assumptions about reality. <br><br>In <i>Einstein's Unfinished Revolution</i>, theoretical physicist Lee Smolin provocatively argues that the problems which have bedeviled quantum physics since its inception are unsolved and unsolvable, for the simple reason that the theory is incomplete. There is more to quantum physics, waiting to be discovered. Our task--if we are to have simple answers to our simple questions about the universe we live in--must be to go beyond quantum mechanics to a description of the world on an atomic scale that makes sense. <br><br>In this vibrant and accessible book, Smolin takes us on a journey through the basics of quantum physics, introducing the stories of the experiments and figures that have transformed our understanding of the universe, before wrestling with the puzzles and conundrums that the quantum world presents. Along the way, he illuminates the existing theories that might solve these problems, guiding us towards a vision of the quantum that embraces common sense realism. <br><br>If we are to have any hope of completing the revolution that Einstein began nearly a century ago, we must go beyond quantum mechanics to find a theory that will give us a complete description of nature. In <i>Einstein's Unfinished Revolution</i>, Lee Smolin brings us a step closer to resolving one of the greatest scientific controversies of our age.</p><p>Lee Smolin has made influential contributions to the search for a unification of physics. He is a founding faculty member of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics. His previous books include <i>Time Reborn, The Trouble with Physics, </i>and<i> Three Roads to Quantum Gravity. </i>"[A] compelling&nbsp;narrative about the development of different strands of quantum physics."&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;<b><i>Financial Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Smolin is an extremely creative thinker who has been a leader in theoretical physics for many years. He is also a gifted writer who manages to translate his own insights about how science works into engaging language and compelling stories . . . Smolin's description of how quantum mechanics works is both elegant and accessible.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b><i>NPR</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[A]mbitious . . .upbeat and, finally, optimistic . . . &nbsp;Smolin is a lucid expositor.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>&nbsp;<i>Nature</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;As the latest entry into the conversation, Smolin&#x2019;s book feels the most immediate and personal. Here is no detached narrator, but an active participant in the fray who perceives the debate over the nature of reality in personal terms. . . While the way forward remains elusive, Smolin and others who seek to illuminate how physics got to where it is today are at least making the quest for answers a bit less costly.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b><i>The Globe and Mail</i>&nbsp;(Toronto)</b> <br>&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;Well-written and engaging.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Sabine Hossenfelder,&nbsp;<i>Backreaction</i></b> <br><br>&#x201c;Smolin offers a masterful exposition on the state of quantum physics, smoothly blending a history of the field with clear explanations, philosophical context and an accessible introduction to fresh ideas.

Unfortunately, Blake's vision is generally known to the world in amputated form: because of the difficulty and expense of reproducing his original conception, most editions of Blake's work offer only the printed text, with no trace of the visual counterpart so essential to his "System."<br>This new, facsimile edition of the <i>Songs of Innocence</i> reproduces Blake's color plates in a fashion which the artist himself would have approved. The 31 plates &#x2014; printed on facing pages which are the same size of Blake's own first edition &#x2014; offer one of the more brightly colored versions of this significant volume, no two copies of which are the same. As a special aid to readers, a typographical reprint of the text of poems follows the plates. Such classic "songs" as "The Lamb" and "The Chimney Sweeper" are now accessible to all in the symbiotic union of poem and picture that is crucial to a total understating of Blake's mind and art.</p></p><p>Painter, printer, and poet, William Blake (1757-1827) was a master at expressing great literature through his art.

This classic book by Wolf D. Storl, a respected elder in the practice of permaculture, details how food is grown holistically and beautifully by traditional communities around the world, and shows how to apply their ancient wisdom to our own gardens.<br><br>With interest in natural, sustainable, organic and local food at an all-time high, people are looking beyond their farmers markets and CSA cooperatives to hyperlocal ways of growing healthy, delicious produce in urban gardens and their own backyards. <i>Culture and Horticulture</i> details time-tested methods that are as effective today as they were hundreds of years ago. On the practical front, the book works as a manual for creating and maintaining a bountiful harvest. It explains how to build the soil to maintain fertility; how to produce compost; how to plant, sow, and tend the various fruit and vegetable plants; how to rotate crops and practice companion planting; how to set up a favorable microclimate; how to deal with so-called weeds and pests; how to harvest at the right time; and finally how to store vegetables and herbs. Special emphasis is given to the art and science of composting, the compost being the "heart" of any self-sufficient garden and a model for the cycle of life, death, and rebirth.<br><br>At the same time the reader is introduced to the wider aspects of horticulture, to its historical, philosophical, and cosmological contexts and social relevance. Gardening is a cultural activity, shaped by peoples' thoughts, wishes, and needs as well as by their cultural traditions. The author, an anthropologist by profession who has investigated the gardening practices of indigenous people throughout the world and worked for many years on biodynamic farms and in his own food garden, will introduce the reader to Rudolf Steiner's vision of the garden as an organic unit, embedded in the context of terrestrial and cosmic forces. Storl explains the importance of cosmic rhythms (solar, lunar, and planetary), the role of biodynamic herbal preparations as "medicines" for the garden organism, and the so-called "etheric" and "astral" forces. The book presents a vision of the garden as seen through the eyes of "Goethean science," a magical place where alchemical transformations of material substances take place.</p><p>Wolf D. Storl, PhD, is an ethnobotanist and the author of some two dozen books on herbalism, alternative medicine, ethnobotany, and shamanism. Born in Saxony, Germany, he received his PhD in ethnology from the University of Berne, Switzerland. His early post-doctorate career includes research in a Swiss biodynamic farming community, teaching anthropology and organic gardening at Rogue College in Oregon, participant-observer research at a traditional Swiss farm, and two years in India as a visiting scholar at the Benares Hindu University. Always interested in local gardening practices in his travels around the world, 25 years ago Dr. Storl was able to put his learning to the test when he and his family moved to a mountain farmstead in southern Germany. There he maintains a year-round vegetable garden and continues to teach, also appearing on television in the U.S. and many countries in Europe as a spokesman for natural horticulture. The author lives in Rohrdorf, Germany.&#x201c;Wolf Storl in <i>Culture and Horticulture</i> shares with us the philosophy and practice of how to stop the war against the soil, and create a culture of making Peace with the Earth. In these times of a handful of corporations trying to control society and the earth by controlling seed and food and agriculture, gardening, especially organic gardening, is a path to freedom. Wolf's book on organic gardening and biodynamic gardening shows us how we can do it&#x2014; each one of us can be a garden revolutionary.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<b>Vandana Shiva</b>, founder of Navdanya International and author of <i>Earth Democracy: Justice, Sustainability, and Peace</i><br><br> &#x201c;<i>Culture and Horticulture </i>is one of my favorite books.

If you want to understand the true lure of golf, turn to Carl Hiaasen, who has written an extraordinary book for the ordinary hacker.</p><p><b>Carl Hiaasen</b> was born and raised in Florida. He is the author of fourteen novels and two children&#x2019;s books. He also writes a weekly column for <i>The Miami Herald</i>.In the summer of 2005, I returned to golf after a much needed layoff of thirty-two years.Attempting a comeback in my fifties wouldn&#x2019;t have been so absurd if I&#x2019;d been a decent player when I was young, but unfortunately that wasn&#x2019;t the case. At my best, I&#x2019;d shown occasional flashes of competence. At my worst, I&#x2019;d been a menace to all carbon-based life-forms on the golf course.On the day I gave up golfing, I stood six-feet even, weighed a stringy 145 pounds and was in relatively sound physical shape. When I returned to the game, I was half an inch taller, twenty-one pounds heavier and nagged by the following age-related ailments:� elevated cholesterol; � a bone spur deep in the right rotator cuff; � an aching right hip; � a permanently weakened right knee, due to a badly torn medial meniscus that was scraped and repaired in February 2003 by the same orthopedic surgeon who&#x2019;d once worked on a young professional quarterback named Dan Marino. (The doctor had assured me that my injury was no worse than Marino&#x2019;s, then he&#x2019;d added with a hearty chuckle, &#x201c;But you&#x2019;re also not twenty-two years old.&#x201d;)Other factors besides my knee joint and HDL had changed during my long absence. When I&#x2019;d abandoned golf in 1973, I had been a happily married father of a two-year-old son. When I returned to the sport in 2005, I was a happily remarried father of a five-year-old son, a fourteen-year-old stepson and a thirty-four-year-old son with three kids of his own. In other words, I was a grandpa.Over those three busy and productive decades, a normal, well-centered person would have mellowed in the loving glow of the family hearth. Not me. I was just as restless, consumed, unreflective, fatalistic and emotionally unequipped to play golf in my fifties as I was in my teens.What possesses a man to return in midlife to a game at which he&#x2019;d never excelled in his prime, and which in fact had dealt him mostly failure, angst and exasperation?Here&#x2019;s why I did it: I&#x2019;m one sick bastard.The Last WaltzMy first taste of golf was as a shag caddy for my father. He often practiced hitting wedges in our front yard, and I&#x2019;d put on my baseball glove and play outfield.Dad seemed genuinely happy when I finally asked to take golf lessons. I was perhaps eleven or twelve, too young to realize that my disposition was ill-suited to a recreation that requires infinite patience and eternal optimism.The club pro was Harold Perry, a pleasant fellow and a solid teacher. He said I had a natural swing, which, I&#x2019;ve since learned, is what pros always say at your first lesson. It&#x2019;s more merciful than: &#x201c;You&#x2019;d have a brighter future chopping cane.&#x201d;The early sessions did seem to go well, and Harold was en- couraging. As time passed, however, he began chain-smoking heavily during our lessons, which suggested to me the existence of a chronic problem for which Harold had no solution. The problem was largely in my head, and fell under the clinical heading of Wildly Unrealistic Expectations.My first major mistake was prematurely asking to join my father for nine holes, a brisk Sunday outing during which I unraveled like a crackhead at a Billy Graham crusade. This was because I&#x2019;d foolishly expected to advance the golf ball down the fairway in a linear path. The experience was marred by angry tears, muffled profanities and long, brittle periods of silence. Worse, a pattern was established that would continue throughout the years that Dad and I played together.Golfers like maxims, and here&#x2019;s a good one: Beginners should never be paired with good players, especially if the good player is one&#x2019;s own father.The harder I tried, the uglier it got. To say that I didn&#x2019;t bear my pain stoically is an understatement. Dad suffered along with me and so did his golf game, which added to my sullen mood an oppressive layer of guilt.There were rare sunbursts of hope when I managed to hit a decent shot or sink a putt, but usually a pall of Nordic gloom followed us around the links. My father was a saint for tolerating my tantrums and sulking. He never once ditched me; whenever I asked to tag along on his regular weekend game, he&#x2019;d say yes despite knowing what histrionics lay ahead. As I grew taller he generously bought me a set of Ben Hogans, which were so gorgeous that at first I was reluctant to throw them.Interestingly, I have no recollection of my father and me completing a round of golf, with the exception of a father-son charity event (and the only reason I didn&#x2019;t flee on the back nine was that I wasn&#x2019;t sure how to get back to the clubhouse). I can&#x2019;t recall our final score, probably for the same reason that victims of serious traffic accidents often cannot remember getting in the car. Trauma wipes clean the memory banks.In high school some of my friends took up golf, and occasionally I joined them on weekends. Surrounded by retirement developments, the Lauderdale Lakes course was a scraggly, unkempt layout that was chosen by us for its dirt-cheap, all-day green fees. Despite the trampled fairways and corrugated greens, I actually started enjoying myself&#x2014;the mood was loose and raunchy, and it was uplifting to discover that my friends stroked the ball as erratically as I did. We were the youngest players on that course by half a century, a disparity that every round precipitated one or two prickly confrontations with foursomes who were less agile and alert. That, of course, only added to the sportive atmosphere.Occasionally we also played a chaotic par-3 layout, upon which I once bladed a 9-iron dead into the cup for an ace. It was a feat that I never replicated. My name (misspelled, naturally) was etched into a hokey hole-in-one plaque that was hung among literally hundreds of others in the funky little clubhouse.My father was undoubtedly relieved that I&#x2019;d found other golfing companions, freeing him to resume his regular Sunday rounds in peace. Unfortunately, bursitis was making it increasingly difficult for him to swing a club, and by the time I left for college he was playing infrequently, and in pain.During my first semester at Emory University I got married and soon thereafter became a father, so for a time I was too preoccupied&#x2014;and too broke&#x2014;for golf.In the summer of 1972 I entered the journalism college at the University of Florida in Gainesville, where I reconnected with my high school buddies. The university maintains a top-notch par-72 that was in those days open to students for $2.50. It was there I broke 90 for the first and only time before giving up the game.I was walking eighteen in a group that included a good friend, Al Simmens. He was hitting the ball well but I was all over the map, scrambling for bogeys and doubles. In the midst of butchering a long par-4, I improbably holed out a full 7-iron for a birdie. Exclamations of amused wonder arose from Big Al and the others. Then, supernaturally, two holes later I knocked in a 9-iron from about 110 yards.This time Al keeled over as if felled by a sniper. Once before I&#x2019;d seen him collapse like that on a golf course. It had happened when he was kneecapped by a drive struck by Larry Robinson, a member of our own foursome&#x2014;the most astoundingly bad tee shot that I&#x2019;ve ever witnessed, to this day. Al had been next up, standing dead even with Larry and seemingly safe, when Larry&#x2019;s abominably mishit ball shot off the tee at a 90 degree angle and smashed into Al&#x2019;s right leg. The impact sounded like a Willie McCovey home run. Incredibly, Al was upright within minutes, and resumed playing with only a slight limp.But after my second hole-out on that morning in Gainesville, he lay lifeless in the fairway with a glassy expression that called to mind Queequeg, the Pacific Island cannibal in <i>Moby-Dick</i>, who&#x2019;d lapsed into a grave trance upon seeing his fate in a throw of the bones. Eventually Al arose and rejoined our group, but he was rocky.I completed the round with no further heroics yet I walked off the 18th green with an 88, my best score ever. That was in the summer of 1973, and by the end of the year I was done. The Hogans sat in a closet, gathering dust.Richard Nixon was hunkered like a meth-crazed badger in the White House, Hank Aaron was one dinger shy of Babe Ruth&#x2019;s all-time home run record, and The Who had just released Quadrophenia.At age twenty, I was more or less at peace.Toad GolfMy divorce from golf was uncomplicated and amic- able. When I came home from college on visits, my father and I would spend Sunday afternoons watching the PGA on television. Dad had always asserted that Sam Snead was the greatest player of all time, but he was gradually coming around to the possibility that Jack Nicklaus was something special.Then, in February 1976, my father died suddenly at the outrageously unfair age of fifty, a tragedy that extinguished any lingering whim I might have had to tackle golf again with serious intent. Apparently I played a round later that year with a friend, although my memory of it is fogged.Possibly I've blocked out other rounds, too. My brother, Rob, says that he and I golfed together one time not long after Dad passed away. "It wasn't good," he tells me.The next time I recall swinging a club wasn't in any conventional, or socially acceptable, format.It occurred one night that same year, when my best friend and fishing companion, Bob Branham, called to report a disturbing infestation. The culprit was <i>Bufo marinus, </i>a large and brazen type of toad that had invaded South Florida from Central America and proliferated rapidly, all but exterminating the more docile native species. The <i>Bufo </i>grows to two pounds and eats anything that fits in its maw, including small birds and mice. When threatened, it excretes from two glands behind its eyes a milky toxin extremely dangerous to mammals. Adventuresome human substance abusers have claimed that licking <i>Bufo </i>toads produces psychedelic visions, but the practice is often fatal for dogs and cats.Which is why Bob had called. Every evening a brigade of <i>Bufo</i>s had been appearing outside his back door and gobbling all the food he'd put out for Dixie, his young Labrador retriever. It's probably unnecessary to point out that while Labradors possess a cheery and endearing temperament, they are not Mensa candidates in the kingdom of canines. In fact, Labs will eagerly eat, lick or gnaw objects far more disgusting than a sweaty toad. For that reason, Bob expressed what I felt was a well-founded fear that his beloved pet was in peril during these nightly <i>Bufo </i>encounters.When I arrived at his house, the onslaught was in progress. A herd of medium-sized toads hungrily patrolled the perimeter of his patio, while one exceptionally rotund specimen had vaulted into Dixie's dish and engulfed so much dog chow that it was unable to climb out. It looked like a mud quiche with eyeballs.As kids, Bob and I had roamed the Everglades collecting wild critters, so neither of us wanted to harm the <i>Bufo</i>s. Yet there seemed no choice but to remove them quickly and by force, before his dopey dog slurped one like a Popsicle.Ballasted with Alpo, the toads would have been easy to capture by hand. That, however, would have presented two serious problems. One was the poison; the other was pee. Toads are prodigious pissers, and <i>Bufo</i>s in particular own hair-trigger bladders. The instant you pick one up, the hosing commences and does not cease until you drop it.Bob and I were discussing our limited and unsavory options when I noticed a golf bag in a corner near the back door. We had a brief conversation about which of his neighbors was the most obnoxious, and then I reached for a 9-iron. Bob chose a 7.Before the PETA rally begins, let me point out that an adult <i>Bufo </i>toad is one of God's sturdiest creatures. Bob swears he once saw one get run over by a compact car and then hop away. I have my doubts, but in any case we purposely picked lofted clubs to effect a kinder, gentler relocation.Aerodynamically, your average toad travels through the air with substantially more drag than a golf ball. This is because golf balls are usually round, and legless. A toad won't carry as far, or roll more than once or twice when it lands. Nonetheless, I soon found the range with Bob's 9-iron, chipping several beefy <i>Bufo</i>s onto a window awning two houses away. Even at that distance we could hear the feisty invaders clomping across the flimsy aluminum before free-falling into the backyard of their new, unsuspecting hosts.Purists probably wouldn't consider clandestine toad launching as true golf, but for accuracy's sake it must be reported that I took five or six swings with an iron that night. The next time I touched a club was in August 1977, while vacationing in Asheville, North Carolina. The trip stands out for two reasons: Elvis Presley died that week, and I got my first (and last) taste of genuine mountain moonshine. However, I was neither grief-stricken nor bombed when I accompanied a friend to a municipal driving range, which--using borrowed clubs--I chopped into wet clots of flying sod.During self-imposed retirement I continued to follow the professional tour as a fan, and in 1978 I even attended what was then called the Jackie Gleason Inverrary Classic in Lauderhill. On the afternoon that I was in the gallery, Nicklaus ran off five consecutive birdies on his way to dusting the field. His performance was so otherwordly that it validated my decision to abandon the game; the only way I belonged on a golf course was as a spectator.Then, in November 2002, another slip occurred, and it ultimately set me on the cart path to perdition.</p><h2>Erewhon (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>Setting out to make his fortune in a far-off country, a young traveller discovers the remote and beautiful land of Erewhon and is given a home among its extraordinarily handsome citizens.

He was educated at Shrewsbury and St John&#x2019;s College Cambridge and, after a disagreement with his father about his choice of career, left England to become a sheep farmer in New Zealand, where he stayed until 1864. On his return to England, he took up residence in Clifford&#x2019;s Inn where he stayed until his death. He began to study painting and worked at it for ten years, exhibiting occasionally at the Royal Academy. In 1872 he anonymously published <b>Erewhon</b> which was based on the letters he wrote to his father from New Zealand. This was followed by <b>The Fair Haven</b>, an attack on the Resurrection, making clear the religious skepticism which had turned Butler against a career in the church.<p>In the years that followed, Butler wrote several works attacking contemporary scientific ideas, in particular Darwin&#x2019;s theory of natural selection. In 1881 he began to write books on art and travel, the first of these being <b>Alps and Sanctuaries of Piedmont and the Canton Ticino</b>. Around this time, he was also experimenting with musical composition and collaborated with Festing Jones on the oratorio entitled <b>Narcissus</b>. An interest in Homer led him to write lively translations of <b>The Iliad </b>and <b>The Odyssey </b>and he formed the theory that these two works were written by a woman. Butler&#x2019;s partly autobiographical work <b>The Way of All Flesh </b>was the result of many years&#x2019; labor and appeared posthumously in 1903.</p></p><h2>Nine Days in Heaven, A True Story: In the Summer of 1848, Marietta Davis Experienced an Amazing Vision of Heaven and Hell that Changed Her Life.

If you haven't read it recently, though, you may not remember the sweeping force of the prose, the grotesque, surreal imagery, and the multilayered <i>doppelg�nger</i> themes of Mary Shelley's masterpiece. As fantasy writer Jane Yolen writes of this (the reviewer's favorite) edition, "The strong black and whites of the main text [illustrations] are dark and brooding, with unremitting shadows and stark contrasts. But the central conversation with the monster--who owes nothing to the overused movie image ... but is rather the novel's charnel-house composite--is where [Barry] Moser's illustrations show their greatest power ... The viewer can all but smell the powerful stench of the monster's breath as its words spill out across the page. Strong book-making for one of the world's strongest and most remarkable books."

He knows everything about it: the battles, the generals, every movement of the Union and Confederate Armies. So when the last assignment of seventh-grade history is a project on the Civil War, Oliver is over the moon--until he's partnered with Ella Berry, the slacker girl with the messy hair who does nothing but stare out the window. And when Oliver finds out they have to research a random soldier named Private Raymond Stone who didn't even fight in any battles before dying of some boring disease, Oliver knows he's doomed. <br><br>But Ella turns out to be very different from what Oliver expected. As the partners film their documentary about Private Stone--with Oliver's friend Kevin signing on as their head writing consultant--Oliver discovers that sometimes the most interesting things are hiding in uninteresting places. Even Private Stone is better than expected: There's a mystery buried in his past, and Oliver knows he can figure it out.</p><p>This book is taken directly from my daily life: teaching middle school.

It is a message he has been preaching for more than seventy years. And in this book you will sense its urgency, filled with hope for the future.&nbsp;</p><p>"Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved" (Acts 16:31)</p><p><b>From America&#x2019;s&nbsp;</b><b>evangelistic elder&nbsp;</b><b>statesman</b></p><p>Salvation is what we all long for, when we are lost or in danger or have made a mess of our lives. And salvation belongs to us, when we reach out for the only One who can rescue us&#x2015;Jesus.</p><p>The saving message of the Gospel is the heartbeat of this preacher and evangelist. Millions around the world have heard Billy Graham proclaim this unchanging truth. He has never forgotten the transformation of his own life, when he first said yes to God&#x2019;s gift of salvation, and he has witnessed multitudes turn their hearts to the God of Hope.</p><p><i>The Reason for My Hope: Salvation&nbsp;</i>presents the essence of that transformative message. It is biblical and timeless, and though simple and direct, it is far from easy. There are hard words, prophetic words, directed toward a culture that denies the reality of sin and distracts us from the veracity of Hell. But through its ominous warnings shines a light that cannot be extinguished&#x2015;a beacon of hope that Jesus came &#x201c;to seek and to save that which was lost&#x201d; (Luke 19:10).</p></p><p><p>Billy Graham, world-renowned preacher, evangelist, and author, delivered the gospel message to more people face-to-face than anyone in history and ministered on every continent of the world in more than 185 countries. Millions have read his inspirational classics, including&nbsp;<em>Angels</em>,<em>&nbsp;Peace with God</em>,<em>&nbsp;The Holy Spirit</em>,<em>&nbsp;Hope for the Troubled Heart</em>,<em>&nbsp;How to Be Born Again</em>,<em>&nbsp;The Journey</em>,&nbsp;<em>Nearing Home</em>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>The Reason for My Hope.</em></p>Age and illness have removed him from the public eye, but only death will stop Graham from promulgating the same good news of salvation in Jesus Christ that he has preached now for 70 years. Only some of his exempla are new, drawn from recent headlines and the web, but, as always, Graham makes the message fresh, makes it new, in a plain-speaking and personal manner that few other evangelists have mastered quite as well. He remains absolutely faithful to the text of the Bible, as sure of sin and damnation as they are biblically portrayed as he is of repentance, salvation, and heaven. Moreover, he is as convinced of prophecy&#x2014;that Jesus&#x2019; coming was foretold and that his Second Coming is certain&#x2014;as ever. He doesn&#x2019;t acknowledge nuance (although he doesn&#x2019;t condemn metaphorical reading of scripture, either), and&#x2014;what upsets contemporary sensibilities much more&#x2014;he adheres to traditional understandings, for example of marriage, as firmly as to traditional evangelical interpretation of the Bible.

Jung: Volume 9, Part II, AION: Researches Into the Phenomenology of the Self</h2><p><p><i>Aion</i>, originally published in German in 1951, is one of the major works of Jung's later years. The central theme of the volume is the symbolic representation of the psychic totality through the concept of the Self, whose traditional historical equivalent is the figure of Christ. Jung demonstrates his thesis by an investigation of the Allegoria Christi, especially the fish symbol, but also of Gnostic and alchemical symbolism, which he treats as phenomena of cultural assimilation. The first four chapters, on the ego, the shadow, and the anima and animus, provide a valuable summation of these key concepts in Jung's system of psychology.</p></p><p>"Much of the material in this book and many of the conclusions are fascinating. There is a great deal here to illustrate the background of modern mysticism and much which the reader, of whatever orientation, will regard as insight." (<i>Psychiatric Quarterly</i>)<br><br>"<i>Aion</i> contains some of Jung's most advanced thinking on the integrative principles of the psyche, and on the relation of matter to the symbolic processes of the collective unconscious. This is difficult ground to explore, but those who attempt the journey will find that their horizons have been surprisingly widened." (<i>Psychosomatic Medicine</i>)</p><h2>Art in Theory: 1815-1900 An Anthology of Changing Ideas</h2><p><i>Art in Theory 1815-1900</i> provides the most wide-ranging and comprehensive collection of documents ever assembled on nineteenth-century theories of art.</p><p>The ideas of some of the most influential artists, writers and thinkers of our times about 19th century art are collected in this vast collection of essays. Collectively they tackle difficult issues like the definition of Modern art and tracing the history of aesthetics. Schopenhauer addresses originality and genius, Karl Marx tackles the modern condition, Sir William Newton and Charles Baudelaire struggle with the new notion of photography as art. An 1881 essay by Juis-Karl Huysmans in which he writes of Degas's Little Dancer as "the only genuinely modern experiment in sculpture that I have yet encountered" is a notable inclusion in this volume which includes literally hundreds of texts (many of them translated into English in order to be included in the anthology) that address the artistic issues of the era as well as the social, historical and cultural elements that impacted it. The editors are noted art historians and philosophers who do an excellent job of introducing each chapter as well as the individual pieces of writing where necessary. <i>Art in Theory</i> is an essential reference for students of art as well as anyone interested in the cultural development of the 19th century.<i>Art in Theory 1815-1900</i> provides the most wide-ranging and comprehensive collection of documents ever assembled on nineteenth-century theories of art. Like its highly successful companion volume, <i>Art in Theory 1900-1990,</i> also edited by Charles Harrison and Paul Wood, its primary aim is to provide students and teachers with the documentary material for informed and up-to-date study. Its 260 texts, clear organization and considerable editorial content in this anthology furnish a vivid and indispensable introduction to the history of the art of the period. The anthology is also invaluable to anyone interested in the wider cultural debates of the nineteenth century, and in the development of modern aesthetic theories. <br> <p>Harrison, Wood and Gaiger collect writings by artists, critics, philosophers and literary figures, some reprinted in their entirety, others excerpted from longer works. Among the major themes treated are concepts of genius and originality, modes of landscape painting, approaches to Realism, the question of Modernity and debates over Impressionism, theories of optics and color, the aesthetics of photography, and the rise of photography. Each section is prefaced by an essay that situates the ideas of the period in their historical context, while relating theoretical concerns and debates to developments in the practice of art. Each text is briefly introduced by an outline giving the circumstances of its original appearance and indicating its relevance to the development of modern artistic theory. An extensive bibliography is also provided.</p></p><h2>The Idea of History</h2><p><em>The Idea of History</em> is the best-known work of the great Oxford philosopher, historian, and archaeologist R.G. Collingwood. It was originally published posthumously in 1946, having been mainly reconstructed from Collingwood's manuscripts, many of which are now lost. This important work examines how the idea of history has evolved from the time of Herodotus to the twentieth century, and offers Collingwood's own view of what history is. For this revised edition, Collingwood's most important lectures on the philosophy of history are published here for the first time. These texts have been prepared by Jan van der Dussen from manuscripts that have only recently become available. The lectures contain Collingwood's first comprehensive statement of his philosophy of history; they are therefore essential for a full understanding of his thought, and in particular for a correct interpretation of <em>The Idea of History</em> itself.

It is the second highest peak of the world and is considered the most difficult 8000er to climb. An expedition to the K2 typically lasts several months in the summer, when the weather is most favorable. Even in summer, snow storms are frequent. An expedition requires thousands of pounds of equipment, including climbing gear, severe weather protection gear, tents, food, communication equipment, and pay and shoes for hundreds of porters. Planning such an expedition takes a significant amount of time in the life of a climber and requires dozens of participants in supporting roles. Once on site, many unexpected events, such as avalanches, porter strikes, or equipment failures, will force the climbers to adapt, find new solutions, or retreat. The success rate for expeditions to the K2 is currently less than 40%. </p><p> The United States National Airspace System (NAS) monitors and controls air traffic in the United States. The NAS includes more than 18,300 airports, 21 air route traffic control centers, and over 460 control towers. This adds up to more than 34,000 pieces of equipment, including radars, communication switches, radios, computer systems, and displays. The current infrastructure is aging rapidly. The computers supporting the 21 air route traffic control centers, for example, are IBM 3083 mainframes that date back to the early 1980s. In 1996, the United States government initiated a program to modernize the NAS infrastructure, including improvements such as satellite navigation, digital controller/pilot communications, and a higher degree of automation in controlling the air routes, the order in which aircraft land, and control of ground traffic as aircraft move from and to the runways. Modernizing such a complex infrastructure, however, can only be done incrementally. Consequently, while new components offering new functionality are introduced, older components still need to be supported. For example, during the transition period, a controller will have to be able to use both analog and digital voice channels to communicate with pilots. Finally, the modernization of the NAS coincides with a dramatic increase in global air traffic, predicted to double within the next 10-15 years. The previous modernizing effort of the NAS, called the Advanced Automation System (AAS), was suspended in 1994 because of software-related problems, after missing its initial deadline by several years and exceeding its budget by several billions of dollars. </p><p> Both of the above examples discuss complex systems, where external conditions can trigger unexpected changes. Complexity puts the problem beyond the control of any single individual. Change forces participants to move away from well-known solutions and to invent new ones. In both examples, several participants need to cooperate and develop new techniques to address these challenges. Failure to do so results in the failure to reach the goal. </p><p> This book is about conquering complex and changing software systems. The theme </p><p> The application domain (mountain expedition planning, air traffic control, financial systems, word processing) usually includes many concepts that software developers are not familiar with. The solution domain (user interface toolkits, wireless communication, middleware, database management systems, transaction processing systems, wearable computers, etc.) is often immature and provides developers with many competing implementation technologies. Consequently, the system and the development project are complex, involving many different components, tools, methods, and people. </p><p> As developers learn more about the application domain from their users, they update the requirements of the system. As developers learn more about emerging technologies or about the limitations of current technologies, they adapt the system design and implementation. As quality control finds defects in the system and users request new features, developers modify the system and its associated work products, resulting in continuous change. </p><p> Complexity and change represent challenges that make it impossible for any single person to control the system and its evolution. If controlled improperly, complexity and change defeat the solution before its release, even if the goal is in sight. Too many mistakes in the interpretation of the application domain make the solution useless for the users, forcing a retreat from the route or the market. Immature or incompatible implementation technologies result in poor reliability and delays. Failure to handle change introduces new defects in the system and degrades performance beyond usability. </p><p> This book reflects more than 10 years of building systems and of teaching software engineering project courses. We have observed that students are taught programming and software engineering techniques in isolation, often using small problems as examples. As a result, they are able to solve well-defined problems efficiently, but are overwhelmed by the complexity of their first real development experience, when many different techniques and tools need to be used and different people need to collaborate. Reacting to this state of affairs, the typical undergraduate curriculum now often includes a software engineering project course, organized as a single development project. The tools: UML, Java, and Design Patterns </p><p> We wrote this book with a project course in mind. This book can be used, however, in other situations as well, such as short and intensive workshops or short-term R&amp;D projects. We use examples from real systems and examine the interaction between state-of-the art techniques, such as UML (Unified Modeling Language), Java-based technologies, design patterns, design rationale, configuration management, and quality control. Moreover, we discuss project management related issues that are related to these techniques and their impact on complexity and change. The principles </p><p> We teach software engineering following five principles: </p><p> Practical experience. We believe that software engineering education must be linked with practical experience. Understanding complexity can only be gained by working with a complex system; that is, a system that no single student can completely understand. </p><p> Problem solving. We believe that software engineering education must be based on problem solving. Consequently, there are no right or wrong solutions, only solutions that are better or worse relative to stated criteria. Although we survey existing solutions to real problems and encourage their reuse, we also encourage criticism and the improvement of standard solutions. </p><p> Limited resources. If we have sufficient time and resources, we could perhaps build the ideal system. There are several problems with such a situation. First, it is not realistic. Second, even if we had sufficient resources, if the original problem rapidly changes during the development, we would eventually deliver a system solving the wrong problem. As a result, we assume that our problem-solving process is limited in terms of resources. Moreover, the acute awareness of scarce resources encourages a component-based approach, reuse of knowledge, design, and code. In other words, we support an engineering approach to software development. </p><p> Interdisciplinarity. Software engineering is an interdisciplinary field. It requires contributions from areas spanning electrical and computer engineering, computer science, business administration, graphic design, industrial design, architecture, theater, and writing. Software engineering is an applied field. When trying to understand and model the application domain, developers interact regularly with others, including users and clients, some of whom know little about software development. This requires viewing and approaching the system from multiple perspectives and terminologies. </p><p> Communication. Even if developers build software for developers only, they would still need to communicate among themselves. As developers, we cannot afford the luxury of being able to communicate only with our peers. We need to communicate alternatives, articulate solutions, negotiate trade-offs, and review and criticize others' work. A large number of failures in software engineering projects can be traced to the communication of inaccurate information or to missing information. We must learn to communicate with all project participants, including, most importantly, the client and the end users. </p><p> These five principles are the basis for this book. They encourage and enable the reader to address complex and changing problems with practical and state-of-the-art solutions. The book </p><p> This book is based on object-oriented techniques applied to software engineering. It is neither a general software engineering book that surveys all available methods nor a programming book about algorithms and data structures. Instead, we focus on a limited set of techniques and explain their application in a reasonably complex environment, such as a multiteam development project that includes 20-60 participants. Consequently, this book also reflects our biases, our strengths, and our weaknesses. We hope, nevertheless, that all readers will find something they can use. The book is structured into 12 chapters organized into four parts, which can be taught as a semester-long course. </p><p> Part I, Getting Started, includes three chapters. In this part, we focus on the basic skills necessary for a developer to function in a software engineering context.</p><p>In Chapter 1, Introduction to Software Engineering, we describe the difference between programming and software engineering, the current challenges in our discipline, and basic definitions of concepts we use throughout the book. In Chapter 2, Modeling with UML, we describe the basic elements of a modeling language, UML (Unified Modeling Language), used in object-oriented techniques. We present modeling as a technique for dealing with complexity. This chapter teaches the reader how to read and understand UML diagrams. Subsequent chapters teach the reader how to build UML diagrams to model various aspects of the system. We use UML throughout the book to model a variety of artifacts, from software systems to processes and work products. In Chapter 3, Project Communication, we discuss the single most critical activity that developers perform. Developers and managers spend more than half of their time communicating with others, either face-to-face or via E-mail, groupware, video conference, or written documents. While modeling deals with complexity, communication deals with change. We describe the main means of communications, their application, and discuss what constitutes effective communication. </p><p> In Part II, Dealing with Complexity, we focus on methods and technologies that enable developers to specify, design, and implement complex systems.</p><p>In Chapter 4, Requirements Elicitation, and Chapter 5, Analysis, we describe the definition of the system from the users' point of view. During requirements elicitation, developers determine the functionality users need and a usable way of delivering it. During analysis, developers formalize this knowledge and ensure its completeness and consistency. We focus on how UML is used to deal with application domain complexity. In Chapter 6, System Design, we describe the definition of the system from the developers' point of view. During this phase, developers define the architecture of the system in terms of design goals and a subsystem decomposition. They address global issues, such as the mapping of the system onto hardware, the storage of persistent data, and global control flow. We focus on how developers can use design patterns, components, and LTML to deal with solution domain complexity. In Chapter 7, Object Design, we describe the detailed modeling and construction activities related to the solution domain. We refine the requirements and system models and specify precisely the classes that constitute the system and define the boundary of existing class libraries and frameworks. For the specification of class interfaces we use UML's Object Constraint Language. </p><p> In Part III, Managing Change, we focus on methods and technologies that support the control, assessment, and implementation of changes throughout the life cycle. In Chapter 8, Rationale Management, we describe the capture of design decisions and their justifications. The models we develop during requirements elicitation, analysis, and system design help us deal with complexity, by providing us with different perspectives on what the system should be doing and how it should do it. To be able to deal with change, we need also to know why the system is the way it is. Capturing design decisions, the evaluated alternatives, and their argumentation enables us to access the rationale of the system. In Chapter 9, Testing, we describe the validation of system behavior against the system models. Testing detects faults in the system, including those introduced during changes to the system or its requirements. Testing activities include unit testing, integration testing, and system testing. We describe several testing techniques such as whitebox, blackbox, path testing, state-based testing, and inspections. In Chapter 10, Software Configuration Management, we describe techniques and tools for modeling the project history. Configuration management complements rationale in helping us deal with change. Version management records the evolution of the system. Release management ensures consistency and quality across the components of a release. Change management ensures that modifications to the system are consistent with project goals. In Chapter 11, Project Management, we describe techniques necessary for initiating a software development project, tracking its progress, and dealing with risks and unplanned events. We focus on organizations, roles, and management activities that allow a large number of participants to collaborate and deliver a high-quality system within planned constraints. </p><p> In Part IV, Starting Over, we revisit the concepts we described in the previous chapters from a process perspective. In Chapter 12, Software Life Cycle, we describe software life cycles, such as Boehm's Spiral Model and the Unified Software Development Process, which provide an abstract model of development activities. In this chapter, we also describe the Capability Maturity Model, which is used for assessing the maturity of organizations. We conclude with two examples of software life cycles, which can be applied in a class project. </p><p> The topics above are strongly interrelated. To emphasize their relationships, we selected an iterative approach. Each chapter consists of five sections. In the first section, we introduce the issues relevant to the topic with an illustrative example. In the second section, we describe briefly the activities of the topic. In the third section, we explain the basic concepts of the topic with simple examples. In the fourth section, we detail the technical activities with examples from real systems. Finally, we describe management activities and discuss typical trade-offs.

There are those Christian conservatives who view the Bible as the literal word of God and the events detailed therein as historical fact. Other, more liberal Christians see the Good Book primarily as literature, a metaphor for how people should live. Mine the pages of the <i>Biblical Archeological Review</i> and you'll find scientists trying to prove or disprove the historical reality of Old and New Testament events and structures--everything from the Ark of the Covenant to King David's palace. In <i>An Introduction to the New Testament</i>, author Raymond E. Brown, a Catholic priest, ignores the swirl of conflict surrounding the Bible as historical artifact, concentrating instead on the message it contains. <p> Father Brown analyzes each of the 27 books in the New Testament, devoting painstaking attention to sources, dates, and authorship, as well as commentary on the spiritual, historical, and thematic aspects. He believes that modern-day Bible readers can only interpret it within its historical context. <i>An Introduction to the New Testament</i>, read with a Bible in hand, can only enrich and deepen your understanding of that germinal religious text.</p>Every generation needs a comprehensive, reliable Introduction to the New Testament that opens the biblical text to the novice.

The in-depth focus on applications separates this book from others, and helps students to see how linear algebra can be applied to real-life situations. Some of the more contemporary topics of applied linear algebra are included here which are not normally found in undergraduate textbooks. Theoretical developments are always accompanied with detailed examples, and each section ends with a number of exercises from which students can gain further insight. Moreover, the inclusion of historical information provides personal insights into the mathematicians who developed this subject. The textbook contains numerous examples and exercises, historical notes, and comments on numerical performance and the possible pitfalls of algorithms.

Although policy talk has sounded a millennial tone, the actual reforms have been gradual and incremental. <i>Tinkering toward Utopia</i> documents the dynamic tension between Americans' faith in education as a panacea and the moderate pace of change in educational practices.</p><p>In this book, David Tyack and Larry Cuban explore some basic questions about the nature of educational reform. Why have Americans come to believe that schooling has regressed? Have educational reforms occurred in cycles, and if so, why? Why has it been so difficult to change the basic institutional patterns of schooling? What actually happened when reformers tried to "reinvent" schooling?</p><p>Tyack and Cuban argue that the ahistorical nature of most current reform proposals magnifies defects and understates the difficulty of changing the system. Policy talk has alternated between lamentation and overconfidence. The authors suggest that reformers today need to focus on ways to help teachers improve instruction from the inside out instead of decreeing change by remote control, and that reformers must also keep in mind the democratic purposes that guide public education.</p></p><p>Tinkering Toward Utopia documents the dynamic tension between Americans faith in education as a panacea and the moderate pace of change in educational practices.

In neighboring Lulling, Charles Henstock admires the blooming garden of his new vicarage, glad that the squabbles with his parishoners in Affairs at Thrush Green are settled. And yet the good vicar wistfully recalls his former home - the ugly, old rectory of Thrush Green, which burned to the ground. Now, from the rectory's ruins, the villagers are building eight retirement homes for the older folks most in need. But how to choose who will live there? How will they get on together?

More than six decades after the technological discoveries that led to the Green Revolution aimed at ending world hunger, regular food shortages, malnutrition, and poverty still plague vast swaths of the world. And with increasing food prices, climate change, resource inequality, and an ever-increasing global population, the future holds further challenges.In <i>One Billion Hungry</i>, Sir Gordon Conway, one of the world's foremost experts on global food needs, explains the many interrelated issues critical to our global food supply from the science of agricultural advances to the politics of food security. He expands the discussion begun in his influential <i>The Doubly Green Revolution: Food for All in the Twenty-First Century</i>, emphasizing the essential combination of increased food production, environmental stability, and poverty reduction necessary to end endemic hunger on our planet. Conway addresses a series of urgent questions about global hunger: � How we will feed a growing global population in the face of a wide range of adverse factors, including climate change? � What contributions can the social and natural sciences make in finding solutions?� And how can we engage both government and the private sector to apply these solutions and achieve significant impact in the lives of the poor?Conway succeeds in sharing his informed optimism about our collective ability to address these fundamental challenges if we use technology paired with sustainable practices and strategic planning.Beginning with a definition of hunger and how it is calculated, and moving through issues topically both detailed and comprehensive, each chapter focuses on specific challenges and solutions, ranging in scope from the farmer's daily life to the global movement of food, money, and ideas. Drawing on the latest scientific research and the results of projects around the world, Conway addresses the concepts and realities of our global food needs: the legacy of the Green Revolution; the impact of market forces on food availability; the promise and perils of genetically modified foods; agricultural innovation in regard to crops, livestock, pest control, soil, and water; and the need to both adapt to and slow the rate of climate change.<i> One Billion Hungry</i> will be welcomed by all readers seeking a multifaceted understanding of our global food supply, food security, international agricultural development, and sustainability.</p></p><p>Sir Gordon Conway is Professor of International Development at Imperial College London.

That summer she had just buried her mother when she was hired to survey the gardens of an old, crumbling English country house. Moving into the house, Frances&#x2014;a 39 year-old woman whose life in many ways had been smothered by her mother&#x2014;discovers that a couple is living there as well. Cara and Peter are a glamorous duo, and soon Frances is invited into their life of lavish meals, booze, and cigarettes. It is like an awakening for Frances. But the author Claire Fuller has been weaving her story from the beginning&#x2014;and as Frances begins to catch on that all is not as it seems, so does the reader. By the end, there will be lies, revelations, twists and turns&#x2014;and crimes will be committed. Fuller is a master at drawing the lines between people, invisible and visible, and then pulling those lines like a puppeteer. <em>--Chris Schluep, for the Amazon Book Review</em>Claire Fuller&nbsp;was born in Oxfordshire, England, in 1967.

An unexpected gift allows the Klars to make one more desperate move, this time to the Midwest and a place called Swede Hollow.</p><p>Their new home is a cluster of rough-hewn shacks in a deep, wooded ravine on the edge of St. Paul, Minnesota. The Irish, Italian, and Swedish immigrants who live here are a hardscrabble lot usually absent from the familiar stories of Swedish American history. The men hire on as poorly paid day laborers for the Great Northern or Northern Pacific railroads or work at the nearby brewery, and the women clean houses, work at laundries, or sew clothing in stifling factories. Outsiders malign Swede Hollow as unsanitary and rife with disease, but the Klar family and their neighbors persevere in this neglected corner of the city&#x2014;and consider it home.</p><p>Extensively researched and beautifully written, Ola Larsmo&#x2019;s award-winning novel vividly portrays a family and a community determined to survive. There are hardships, indignities, accidents, and harrowing encounters, but also acts of loyalty and kindness and moments of joy. This haunting story of a real place echoes the larger challenges of immigration in the twentieth century and today.</p></p><p><p>Ola Larsmo is a critic and columnist for Sweden&#x2019;s largest newspaper, <i>Dagens Nyheter</i>, and the author of nine novels and several collections of short stories and essays. He received the Bj�rnson Prize from the Norwegian Academy of Literature and Freedom of Expression and, after the publication of <i>Swede Hollow</i>, two prestigious Swedish awards: the Lagercrantz Critics&#x2019; Prize from <i>Dagens Nyheter</i> and Natur &amp; Kultur&#x2019;s cultural prize. He was president of PEN Sweden from 2009 to 2017 and editor of <i>Bonniers Literary Magazine</i> from 1984 to 1990.</p> &nbsp;<br> Tiina Nunnally is the award-winning translator of Sigrid Undset&#x2019;s novels <i>Kristin Lavransdatter</i>, <i>Jenny</i>, and <i>Marta Oulie</i>.

Ola Larsmo writes with sympathy and grace, and his tale is a quiet epic, full of wonder and dreams and loss. Not to be missed."&#x2014;Larry Millett, author of <i>Metropolitan Dreams</i></p><p>"Ola Larsmo presents a sober and realistic portrayal of the suffering and hardships that awaited Swedish immigrants after they arrived in America. <i>Swede Hollow</i> is a moving, at times harrowing, always convincing novel on a truly epic scale."&#x2014;Steve Sem-Sandberg, author of <i>The Emperor of Lies</i></p><p>"Ola Larsmo has animated a singular place and moment in the story of Minnesota&#x2019;s settlement by Europeans.&nbsp;Larsmo is a faithful storyteller, rooted in historical incident, hearing the voices and breathing life into people who risked everything to forge new beginnings and raise up families by sweat, fist, and the ragged, life-giving fabric of clan."&#x2014;Peter C. Brown, author of <i>The Fugitive Wife</i></p><br><br><p>"Those looking for a conventional plot won't find it here: Larsmo writes believable scenes grounded in sensory experience, with relatively complicated characters, in some sort of chronological order, but also seems content to branch out into what are essentially self-contained short stories about characters peripheral to the main intertwined family saga. A worthy addition to the shelf of books about the immigrant experience." &#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p></p><h2>We Landed by Moonlight - Secret RAF Landings in France 1940-1944</h2><p>For most of the 2nd World War the RAF flew small aircraft into Occupied France at night, landing and taking off in total secrecy. Their mission was to transport agents to and from France to support the activities of the French Resistance and SOE. The chronicle of these operations tells an extraordinary adventure story, full of danger for both agent and aviator.

From the legendary origins of this weaving, the story unfolds to tell of the women who wove it, of the source and inspiration for the designs which adorn it, and of the pride and esteem in which it was held by the society which gave it birth. The Dancing Blanket was a robe reserved for ceremony. The remarkable photographs of Tony Hunt performing the Headdress Dance afford a rare opportunity to see this blanket in its full glory, alive and dancing.</p> <p>The story does not stop with an overview of the Dancing Blanket, but delves into the mysteries of its creation. Mountain goat wool and cedar bark were spun and dyed and then woven into intricate, stylized designs. In this magnificently illustrated text, author Cheryl Samuel presents a detailed description of the weaving techniques which were perfected by the Tlingit women. Photographs of Dancing Blankets from many museum collections and of weavings in progress are knitted together with beautiful drawings in order to illustrate this complicated process. <em>The Chilkat Dancing Blanket </em>interweaves legend, history, and technique and is presented in honor of the women who created this exquisite art form.</p></p><p><p><strong>Cheryl Samuel,</strong> weaver and teacher of weaving and art, was introduced by Bill Holm to the weaving of the Chilkat Indian women. Her involvement in this beautiful form of weaving has grown from an initial technical curiosity, through practical and academic research, to the present day, which finds her weaving on commission for art collectors and for native artists who wish to own and dance in this stunning traditional dress. In 1980 she received a grant from the National Museums of Canada to travel to the major ethnographic collections of North America, Europe, and Russia. During this trip, her knowledge of the weaving techniques crystallized through careful study of many of the finest of old Dancing Blankets. Most recently, Cheryl Samuel was invited to display her Chilkat weaving at Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History.</p> <p>Cheryl Samuel teaches at Lester B. Pearson College of the Pacific, Victoria, British Columbia, where she served for some years as Director of Fine Arts. She lives in Victoria with her husband and their three children.</p>&#34;Cheryl Samuel unravels the mysteries of the Chilkat weavers by thorough research of surviving masterpieces in museums around the world, then reweaves a very readable and well-illustrated account enriched with the legends of the people and rituals of the potlatch....An essential book for both weaving enthusiasts and admirers of Northwest Coast Indian art.&#34;</p><h2>And Every Morning the Way Home Gets Longer and Longer: A Novella</h2><p><b>A little book with a big heart!</b><br> <br>&#x201c;I read this beautifully imagined and moving novella in one sitting, utterly wowed, wanting to share it with everyone I know.&#x201d; &#x2014;Lisa Genova, bestselling author of <i>Still Alice</i><br><br>From the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>A Man Called Ove</i>,<i> My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She&#x2019;s Sorry,</i> and <i>Britt-Marie Was Here</i> comes an exquisitely moving portrait of an elderly man&#x2019;s struggle to hold on to his most precious memories, and his family&#x2019;s efforts to care for him even as they must find a way to let go.<br> <br>With all the same charm of his bestselling full-length novels, here Fredrik Backman once again reveals his unrivaled understanding of human nature and deep compassion for people in difficult circumstances.

Each is a timeless bestseller and has been an inspiration for many of those who are now famous and successful.</p><p>An American writer, lecturer and the developer of famous courses in self-improvement, salesmanship, corporate training, public speaking and interpersonal skills, Dale Carnegie was born in 1888 in Maryville, Missouri. Public Speaking: a Practical Course for Business Men (1926) was the first collection of Carnegies writings. It was later entitled Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business (1932). It was published in 1956 with the title How to Develop Self-Confidence and Influence People by Public Speaking. How to Win Friends and Influence People, when published by Simon and Schuster in 1936, became an instant bestseller. How to Stop Worrying and Start Living (1948) introduces the fundamental facts that one must know about worry and provides the perfect way to conquer it.

To enable all of us to age with dignity and security in the face of this coming Age Wave, our society must learn to value the care of our elders. The process of building a culture that supports care is a key component to restoring the American dream, and, as Ai-Jen Poo convincingly argues, will generate millions of new jobs and breath new life into our national ideals of independence, justice, and dignity.<br> <br>This groundbreaking new book from the director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance offers bold solutions, such as long-term care insurance and cultural change to get all of us to value care, which is already at the heart of a movement transforming what it means to grow old in the United States.

But very quickly his criticism of indulgences became a rejection of the papacy and the Catholic Church emphasizing the Bible as the sole authority for Christian faith, radicalizing a continent, fracturing the Holy Roman Empire, and dividing Western civilization in ways Luther&#x2014;a deeply devout professor and spiritually-anxious Augustinian friar&#x2014;could have never foreseen, nor would he have ever endorsed. From Germany to England, Luther&#x2019;s ideas inspired spontaneous but sustained uprisings and insurrections against civic and religious leaders alike, pitted Catholics against Protestants, and because the Reformation movement extended far beyond the man who inspired it, Protestants against Protestants. The ensuing disruptions prompted responses that gave shape to the modern world, and the unintended and unanticipated consequences of the Reformation continue to influence the very communities, religions, and beliefs that surround us today.</p><p>How Luther inadvertently fractured the Catholic Church and reconfigured Western civilization is at the heart of renowned historian Brad Gregory&#x2019;s <em>Rebel in the Ranks</em>. While recasting the portrait of Luther as a deliberate revolutionary, Gregory describes the cultural, political, and intellectual trends that informed him and helped give rise to the Reformation, which led to conflicting interpretations of the Bible, as well as the rise of competing churches, political conflicts, and social upheavals across Europe. Over the next five hundred years, as Gregory&#x2019;s account shows, these conflicts eventually contributed to further epochal changes&#x2014;from the Enlightenment and self-determination to moral relativism, modern capitalism, and consumerism, and in a cruel twist to Luther&#x2019;s legacy, the freedom of every man and woman to practice no religion at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>With the scholarship of a world-class historian and the keen eye of a biographer, Gregory offers readers an in-depth portrait of Martin Luther, a reluctant rebel in the ranks, and a detailed examination of the Reformation to explain how the events that transpired five centuries ago still resonate&#x2014;and influence us&#x2014;today.</p></p><p><p><strong>BRAD GREGORY</strong> is a professor of European History at Notre Dame and the author of&nbsp;<em>Salvation at Stake: Christian Martyrdom in Early Modern Europe</em>, which received six awards, including the prestigious Phi Alpha Theta Best First Book Award and the American Catholic Historical Association&#x2019;s John Gilmary Shea Prize. His second book,<em>&nbsp;The Unintended Reformation: How a Religious Revolution Secularized Society</em>, was named Book of the Year by <em>The Spectator</em>, the&nbsp;<em>Times Literary Supplement</em>, and <em>ABC Religion &amp; Ethics</em>. He also received the first annual Hiett Prize in the Humanities from the Dallas Institute of Humanities and Culture. He lives in South Bend, Indiana.</p>&#x201c;This is just the book for understanding the momentous changes initiated by the Protestant Reformation five hundred years ago. Brad Gregory expertly describes both the significance of Martin Luther (as the first protestant) and the tremendous impact of the Reformation era on everything that has followed.&#x201d; (<strong>Mark Noll, McAnaney Professor of History Emeritus at the University of Notre Dame and author of Protestantism: A Very Short Introduction</strong>)<br><br>&#x201c;Vividly written and respectful of all parties...<em>Rebel in the Ranks</em>&nbsp;is the story of the why, the who and the how [the Reformation] happened &#x2013; and the consequences. It&#x2019;s also a witness to the cost of weaponizing truth, and pursuing it unmoored from patience, self-criticism and love.&#x201d; (<strong>The Most Rev Charles J Chaput, OFM Cap, Archbishop of Philadelphia</strong>)</p><h2>Henri Cartier-Bresson (New Horizons) /anglais</h2><p>Henri Cartier-Bresson&#39;s photography came to define the 20th century.

From his early encounters with the Surrealists, his film work and his experiences in the Second World War, to the development of his own personal aesthetic, the concept of the decisive moment, and the foundation of Magnum Photos, his influence on the world has been profound and unforgettable.</p><p></p><h2>Earth House Hold: Technical Notes &amp; Queries to Fellow Dharma Revolutionaries</h2><p><p><strong>Both Pound and Williams have shown a good poet can revitalize prose style. <em>Earth House Hold</em> (a play on the root meaning of "ecology"), drawn from Gary Snyder's essays and journals, may prove a landmark for the new generation.</strong></p> "As a poet," Snyder tells us, "I hold the most archaic values on earth. They go back to the late Paleolithic; the fertility of the soil, the magic of animals, the power-vision in solitude, the terrifying intuition and rebirth; the love and ecstasy of the dance, the common work of the tribe." He develops, as replacement for shattered social structures. a concept of tribal tradition which could lead to "growth and enlightenment in self-disciplined freedom. Whatever it is or ever was in any other culture can be reconstructed from the unconscious through meditation...the coming revolution will close the circle and link us in many ways with the most creative aspects of our archaic past."</p><p>Both Pound and Williams have shown a good poet can revitalize prose style. Earth House Hold (a play on the root meaning of &#39;ecology&#39;) drawn from Gary Snyder&#39;s essays and journals, may prove a landmark for the new generation.Born in 1930 in San Francisco, Gary Snyder grew up in the rural Pacific Northwest. He graduated from Reed College in 1951 with degrees in anthropology and literature, and later, 1953&#x2013;56, studied Japanese and Chinese civilization at Berkeley, returning there to teach in the English Department. After participating in the San Francisco revival, the beginning of the beat poetry movement, with Ginsberg, Whalen, Rexroth and McClure, Snyder quietly went off to Japan in 1955 where he stayed for eighteen months, living in a Zen monastery. In 1958, he joined the tanker "Sappa Creek" and traveled around the world. In early 1959 he again returned to Japan where, apart from six months in India, he studied Kyoto under Oda Sesso Roshi, the Zen master and Head Abbot of Daitoku-Ji. He has spent further time (1966&#x2013;67) in Japan on a Bollingen research grant. In 1969 he received a Guggenheim grant and toured the Southwestern United States visiting various Indian tribes.</p><h2>Eddie Olczyk: Beating the Odds in Hockey and in Life</h2><p>Eddie Olczyk had built a life and career most people&nbsp;could only dream of.&nbsp;Growing up in the suburbs of Chicago, he fell in love with the game of hockey during an era when most kids preferred balls to pucks. Against all odds, he played on the 1984 U.S. Olympic hockey team as a 17-year-old, and four months later he was drafted in the first round by his hometown Chicago Blackhawks. During an illustrious 16-year career, he played for and alongside some of the greatest franchises and players in history, winning a Stanley Cup with the unforgettable 1994 New York Rangers. Years later, he coached former teammate Mario Lemieux and Sidney Crosby on the Pittsburgh Penguins before transitioning into the broadcast booth, where he has become one of the most recognizable voices of the sport. He then combined his skills as an analyst with his second passion&#x2014; horse racing&#x2014;and became an integral part of NBC&#x2019;s coverage of thoroughbreds.<br><br> Away from the spotlight, Olczyk and his wife of three decades raised four adoring children. He was respected and admired by fans, friends, and peers. Life was sweet. Then, at 7:07 pm on August 4, 2017, his entire world turned upside down.<br><br> In Eddie Olczyk: Beating the Odds in Hockey and in Life, one of the biggest names in American hockey has written an inspiring and entertaining memoir of his life both on and off the ice. From shooting hundreds of tennis balls at a goal in his childhood living room to the ups and downs of his improbable hockey career to rollicking stories from the booth and the backstretch, Olczyk guides readers on his journey toward his ultimate test: a battle against Stage 3 colon cancer. For years, Olczyk&#x2019;s goal was to be the best husband, father, broadcaster, and handicapper he could be. Today he has a new one: to bring as much awareness and support to those fighting cancer as he possibly can. In this emotional but often hilarious autobiography, you&#x2019;ll learn why the people who know Eddie Olczyk best might describe him as &#x201c;tremendously tremendous.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Eddie Olczyk</b> is an award-winning television commentator on NBC&#x2019;s coverage of the NHL and thoroughbred horse racing, and for the Chicago Blackhawks.

Olczyk, now a sportscaster for NHL and NBC, takes readers through his life and career with insights from coaches, teammates, and family members (after being traded to the Winnipeg Jets in 1999, his mother said in frustration, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re just a piece of meat&#x201d;). Without being self-aggrandizing or boastful, Olcyzk draws readers through the ins and outs of professional sports, from the anxiety of trades to the complexities of victory: in recounting his journey of the 1994 Stanley Cup champion New York Rangers, he notes that he was able to celebrate &#x201c;a dream that every player has from the time they begin to play the game&#x201d; while combatting a personal decline that &#x201c;tested my resolve.&#x201d; While Olczyk discusses the joys of his post-playing career nimbly, it&#x2019;s his unflinching account of his battle with cancer that truly stands out (in the afterword, his children tell their stories about living with their father through these hard times).

Before I became a zombie I must have been a businessman, a banker or broker or some young temp learning the ropes, because I&#x2019;m wearing fairly nice clothes. Black slacks, gray shirt, red tie. M makes fun of me sometimes. He points at my tie and tries to laugh, a choked, gurgling rumble deep in his gut. His clothes are holey jeans and a plain white T-shirt. The shirt is looking pretty macabre by now. He should have picked a darker color. </p><p>We like to joke and speculate about our clothes, since these final fashion choices are the only indication of who we were before we became no one. Some are less obvious than mine: shorts and a sweater, skirt and a blouse. So we make random guesses. </p><p>You were a waitress. You were a student. Ring any bells? </p><p>It never does. </p><p>No one I know has any specific memories. Just a vague, vestigial knowledge of a world long gone. Faint impressions of past lives that linger like phantom limbs. We recognize civilization&#x2014;buildings, cars, a general overview&#x2014;but we have no personal role in it. No history. We are just <i>here</i>. We do what we do, time passes, and no one asks questions. But like I&#x2019;ve said, it&#x2019;s not so bad. We may appear mindless, but we aren&#x2019;t. The rusty cogs of cogency still spin, just geared down and down till the outer motion is barely visible. We grunt and groan, we shrug and nod, and sometimes a few words slip out. It&#x2019;s not that different from before. </p><p>But it does make me sad that we&#x2019;ve forgotten our names. Out of everything, this seems to me the most tragic. I miss my own and I mourn for everyone else&#x2019;s, because I&#x2019;d like to love them, but I don&#x2019;t know who they are. </p><p> </p>� � � <p>There are hundreds of us living in an abandoned airport outside some large city. We don&#x2019;t need shelter or warmth, obviously, but we like having the walls and roofs over our heads. Otherwise we&#x2019;d just be wandering in an open field of dust somewhere, and that would be horrifying. To have nothing at all around us, nothing to touch or look at, no hard lines whatsoever, just us and the gaping maw of the sky. I imagine that&#x2019;s what being full-dead is like. An emptiness vast and absolute. </p><p>I think we&#x2019;ve been here a long time. I still have all my flesh, but there are elders who are little more than skeletons with clinging bits of muscle, dry as jerky. Somehow it still extends and contracts, and they keep moving. I have never seen any of us &#x201c;die&#x201d; of old age. Left alone with plenty of food, maybe we&#x2019;d &#x201c;live&#x201d; forever, I don&#x2019;t know. The future is as blurry to me as the past. I can&#x2019;t seem to make myself care about anything to the right or left of the present, and the present isn&#x2019;t exactly urgent. You might say death has relaxed me. </p><p> </p>� � � <p>I am riding the escalators when M finds me. I ride the escalators several times a day, whenever they move. It&#x2019;s become a ritual. The airport is derelict, but the power still flickers on sometimes, maybe flowing from emergency generators stuttering deep underground. Lights flash and screens blink, machines jolt into motion. I cherish these moments. The feeling of things coming to life. I stand on the steps and ascend like a soul into Heaven, that sugary dream of our childhoods, now a tasteless joke. </p><p>After maybe thirty repetitions, I rise to find M waiting for me at the top. He is hundreds of pounds of muscle and fat draped on a six-foot-five frame. Bearded, bald, bruised and rotten, his grisly visage slides into view as I crest the staircase summit. Is he the angel that greets me at the gates? His ragged mouth is oozing black drool. </p><p>He points in a vague direction and grunts, &#x201c;City.&#x201d; </p><p>I nod and follow him. </p><p>We are going out to find food. A hunting party forms around us as we shuffle toward town. It&#x2019;s not hard to find recruits for these expeditions, even if no one is hungry. Focused thought is a rare occurrence here, and we all follow it when it manifests. Otherwise we&#x2019;d just be standing around and groaning all day. We do a lot of standing around and groaning. Years pass this way. The flesh withers on our bones and we stand here, waiting for it to go. I often wonder how old I am. </p><p> </p>� � � <p>The city where we do our hunting is conveniently close. We arrive around noon the next day and start looking for flesh. The new hunger is a strange feeling. We don&#x2019;t feel it in our stomachs&#x2014;some of us don&#x2019;t even have those. We feel it everywhere equally, a sinking, sagging sensation, as if our cells are deflating. Last winter, when so many Living joined the Dead and our prey became scarce, I watched some of my friends become full-dead. The transition was undramatic. They just slowed down, then stopped, and after a while I realized they were corpses. It disquieted me at first, but it&#x2019;s against etiquette to notice when one of us dies. I distracted myself with some groaning. </p><p>I think the world has mostly ended, because the cities we wander through are as rotten as we are. Buildings have collapsed. Rusted cars clog the streets. Most glass is shattered, and the wind drifting through the hollow high-rises moans like an animal left to die. I don&#x2019;t know what happened. Disease? War? Social collapse? Or was it just us? The Dead replacing the Living? I guess it&#x2019;s not so important. Once you&#x2019;ve arrived at the end of the world, it hardly matters which route you took. </p><p>We start to smell the Living as we approach a dilapidated apartment building. The smell is not the musk of sweat and skin, it&#x2019;s the effervescence of life energy, like the ionized tang of lightning and lavender. We don&#x2019;t smell it in our noses. It hits us deeper inside, near our brains, like wasabi. We converge on the building and crash our way inside. </p><p>We find them huddled in a small studio unit with the windows boarded up. They are dressed worse than we are, wrapped in filthy tatters and rags, all of them badly in need of a shave. M will be saddled with a short blond beard for the rest of his Fleshy existence, but everyone else in our party is cleanshaven. It&#x2019;s one of the perks of being dead, another thing we don&#x2019;t have to worry about anymore. Beards, hair, toenails... no more fighting biology. Our wild bodies have finally been tamed. </p><p>Slow and clumsy but with unswerving commitment, we launch ourselves at the Living. Shotgun blasts fill the dusty air with gunpowder and gore. Black blood spatters the walls. The loss of an arm, a leg, a portion of torso, this is disregarded, shrugged off. A minor cosmetic issue. But some of us take shots to our brains, and we drop. Apparently there&#x2019;s still something of value in that withered gray sponge because if we lose it, we are corpses. The zombies to my left and right hit the ground with moist thuds. But there are plenty of us. We are overwhelming. We set upon the Living, and we eat. </p><p>Eating is not a pleasant business. I chew off a man&#x2019;s arm, and I hate it. I hate his screams, because I don&#x2019;t like pain, I don&#x2019;t like hurting people, but this is the world now. This is what we do. Of course if I don&#x2019;t eat all of him, if I spare his brain, he&#x2019;ll rise up and follow me back to the airport, and that might make me feel better. I&#x2019;ll introduce him to everyone, and maybe we&#x2019;ll stand around and groan for a while. It&#x2019;s hard to say what &#x201c;friends&#x201d; are anymore, but that might be close. If I restrain myself, if I leave enough... </p><p>But I don&#x2019;t. I can&#x2019;t. As always I go straight for the good part, the part that makes my head light up like a picture tube. I eat the brain, and for about thirty seconds, I have memories. Flashes of parades, perfume, music... <i>life</i>. Then it fades, and I get up, and we all stumble out of the city, still cold and gray, but feeling a little better. Not &#x201c;good,&#x201d; exactly, not &#x201c;happy,&#x201d; certainly not &#x201c;alive,&#x201d; but... a little less dead. This is the best we can do. </p><p>I trail behind the group as the city disappears behind us. My steps plod a little heavier than the others&#x2019;. When I pause at a rain-filled pothole to scrub gore off my face and clothes, M drops back and slaps a hand on my shoulder. He knows my distaste for some of our routines. He knows I&#x2019;m a little more sensitive than most. Sometimes he teases me, twirls my messy black hair into pigtails and says, &#x201c;Girl. Such... girl.&#x201d; But he knows when to take my gloom seriously. He pats my shoulder and just looks at me. His face isn&#x2019;t capable of much expressive nuance anymore, but I know what he wants to say. I nod, and we keep walking. </p><p>I don&#x2019;t know why we have to kill people. I don&#x2019;t know what chewing through a man&#x2019;s neck accomplishes. I steal what he has to replace what I lack. He disappears, and I stay. It&#x2019;s simple but senseless, arbitrary laws from some lunatic legislator in the sky. But following those laws keeps me walking, so I follow them to the letter. I eat until I stop eating, then I eat again. </p><p>How did this start? How did we become what we are? Was it some myst...</p></p><h2>The Track of Sand (Inspector Montalbano)</h2><p><b><b><b>&#x201c;You either love Andrea Camilleri or you haven&#x2019;t read him yet.

As he negotiates both the glittering underworld of horseracing and the Mafia's connection to it, Montalbano is aided by his illiterate housekeeper, Adelina, and a Proustian memory of <i>linguate fritte</i>.

From this peculiar equine beginning, Montalbano soon finds himself embroiled in a puzzling case that involves horse stealing, race fixing, and murder. Along the way, of course, there is plenty of time for lunch, though Montalbano&#x2019;s ability to concentrate on his food is impeded by two women who seem more than willing to fill the gap created by Livia&#x2019;s absence. This series is distinguished by Camilleri&#x2019;s remarkable feel for tragicomedy, expertly mixing light and dark in the course of producing novels that are both comforting and disturbing. Here he leans a bit more toward the light side, but fans won&#x2019;t mind a little extra comfort one bit. --Bill Ott</p><h2>Brazil: A Biography</h2><p><p><b>A sweeping and absorbing biography of Brazil, from the sixteenth century to the present</b></p><p>For many Americans, Brazil is a land of contradictions: vast natural resources and entrenched corruption; extraordinary wealth and grinding poverty; beautiful beaches and violence-torn favelas. Brazil occupies a vivid place in the American imagination, and yet it remains largely unknown. </p><p>In an extraordinary journey that spans five hundred years, from European colonization to the 2016 Summer Olympics, Lilia M. Schwarcz and Heloisa M. Starling&#x2019;s <i>Brazil</i> offers a rich, dramatic history of this complex country. The authors not only reconstruct the epic story of the nation but follow the shifting byways of food, art, and popular culture; the plights of minorities; and the ups and downs of economic cycles. Drawing on a range of original scholarship in history, anthropology, political science, and economics, Schwarcz and Starling reveal a long process of unfinished social, political, and economic progress and struggle, a story in which the troubled legacy of the mixing of races and postcolonial political dysfunction persist to this day.</p></p><p><p><b>Lilia M. Schwarcz</b> was born in 1957 in S�o Paulo, Brazil. She is a professor of anthropology at the University of S�o Paulo, a visiting professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Cultures and the Program in Latin American Studies at Princeton University, and the author of <i>The Emperor&#x2019;s Beard</i> and<i> The Spectacle of the Races.</i></p><p><b>Heloisa M.

Illuminating, engrossing, and consistently thoughtful.&#x201d; &#x2015;Larry Rohter, <i>The New York Review of Books</i></p><p>"Evocative . . . Schwarcz and Starling adopt what they call a biographical approach: an attempt to tell the collective stories of the generations of Brazilians that have lived . . . They achieve this with flair in their rich evocations of colonial and imperial Brazil . . . Rich and absorbing." &#x2015;Patrick Wilcken, <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i></p><p>"Compelling and insightful . . . One of Schwarcz and Starling&#x2019;s great strengths is their dissection of changing racial identity." &#x2015;Geoff Dyer, <i>Financial Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;A thoughtful and profound journey into the soul of Brazil . . . The Brazil that emerges from this book is, indeed, a fascinating, complex, multicolored, contradictory and challenging organism, more like a living being than a political, cultural and geographical entity.&#x201d; &#x2015;Laurentino Gomes, <i>Folha de S�o Paulo</i> </p><p>&#x201c;We have been in need of a comprehensive history of Brazil, sensitive and grounded in rigorous research, for some time now; a work that would recognize the advancements of the last five centuries but would also deal frankly with the many obstacles inherent in the building of complete social, political, and racial citizenship. Therefore, this extraordinary tour de force by two of the greatest Brazilian historians in actuality is a very pertinent work.&#x201d; &#x2015;Kenneth Maxwell, founder of the Brazil Studies Program at Harvard University's David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies</p><p>&#x201c;This book is an unauthorized biography of a complex character named Brazil.

It is a new interpretive narrative, challenging, and molded in transparent language alien to the usual academic jargon. The reader will recognize his country, complete with its lights and shadows, and will feel encouraged to participate in the adventure that is its construction.&#x201d; &#x2015;Jos� Murilo de Carvalho, author of <i>The Formation of Souls: Imagery of the Republic in Brazil</i></p></p><h2>You Decide Workbook - Applying the Bill of Rights to Real Cases (Grades 6-12)</h2><p>This 144-page student book is used with the You Decide! teacher's guide&#x2013;sold separately&#x2013;to teach students about the Bill of Rights.

I didn&#x2019;t want it to end.&#x201d; &#x2014;Bill Bryson</strong></p><p><em>Driven by a passion for travel and history and a love of ships and the sea, former Monty Python stalwart and beloved television globe-trotter Michael Palin explores the world of HMS </em>Erebus, <em>last seen on an ill-fated voyage to chart the Northwest Passage.</em></p><p>Michael Palin brings the fascinating story of the <em>Erebus</em> and its occupants to life, from its construction as a bomb vessel in 1826 through the flagship years of James Clark Ross&#x2019;s Antarctic expedition and finally to Sir John Franklin&#x2019;s quest for the holy grail of navigation&#x2014;a route through the Northwest Passage, where the ship disappeared into the depths of the sea for more than 150 years. It was rediscovered under the arctic waters in 2014.</p><p>Palin travels across the world&#x2014;from Tasmania to the Falkland Islands and the Canadian Arctic&#x2014;to offer a firsthand account of the terrain and conditions that would have confronted the <em>Erebus</em> and her doomed final crew. Delving into the research, he describes the intertwined careers of the two men who shared the ship&#x2019;s journeys: Ross, the organizational genius who mapped much of the Antarctic coastline and oversaw some of the earliest scientific experiments to be conducted there; and Franklin, who, at the age of sixty and after a checkered career, commanded the ship on its last disastrous venture. Expertly researched and illustrated with maps, photographs, paintings, and engravings, <em>Erebus</em> is an evocative account of two journeys: one successful and forgotten, the other tragic yet unforgettable.</p></p><p><p><strong>Michael Palin</strong> has written and starred in numerous television programs and films, from <em>Monty Python</em> to <em>A Fish Called Wanda</em>. He is also an acclaimed author, documentary filmmaker, and explorer.

His dauntless curiosity drives us through ice-infested waters from pole to pole, and his passion for weaving together the lives of the men who lived and died on&nbsp;Erebus&nbsp;infuses every page. More than that, though, Palin&#x2019;s contagious spirit of exploration proves that the age of adventure lives on in us still.&#x201d; <strong>&#x2014;Alanna Mitchell, author of&nbsp;<em>The Spinning Magnet: The Force that Created the Modern World and Could Destroy It</em></strong></p><br><p>&#x201c;One robust little tub of a boat, two death-defying voyages to the ends of the earth. Palin has given us a fascinating account of the extraordinary courage of nineteenth-century British sailors and officers. Even the sturdiest vessel is dependent on luck, climate and its captain&#x2019;s skills as he faces ferocious weather, and Palin illuminates&nbsp;with enthusiasm and respect this chilly history of a bomb ship that made its name&nbsp;first as a polar pioneer and&nbsp;then later&nbsp;as a watery tomb.

A word picture is a word that is described by pictures. * You don&#39;t have to be able to read Hebrew in order to understand and to use this book effectively when you read the Bible. * When Hebrew was first written, each letter represented both a sound and a picture. Even if you or the people you teach are not familiar with the Hebrew sounds and have no experience with this language, the pictures you see inside the words will speak for themselves. &#34;I believe that the Hebrew word pictures were designed by God as a tool for Biblical discipleship and teaching his holy words. One constant response I hear, is that the Hebrew word pictures create a new hunger for what the Bible teaches. What I love about the Hebrew word pictures is that they draw people back to the Bible.&#34; Dr. Frank T. Seekins This is not an ordinary book that you read and then set aside - Hebrew Word Pictures is a guide for life that shows new things in your life as times goes by and you experience new events that you test with the Hebrew word pictures. Updated! Now 256 glossy pages of full color, with 80 added pages, with many Hebrew examples and references, plus the book includes an Audio CD that will help you learn the word pictures and hear all the examples on your home stereo.</p><p></p><h2>Selected Short Stories (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>One of the greatest French novelists, Balzac was also an accomplished writer of shorter fiction. This volume includes twelve of his finest short stories - many of which feature characters from his epic series of novels the <i>Com�die Humaine</i>. Compelling tales of acute social and psychological insight, they fully demonstrate the mastery of suspense and revelation that were the hallmarks of Balzac's genius. In "The Atheist's Mass," we learn the true reason for a distinguished atheist surgeon's attendance at religious services; "La Grande Breteche" describes the horrific truth behind the locked doors of a decaying country mansion, while "The Red Inn" relates a brutal tale of murder and betrayal. A fascinating counterpoint to the renowned novels, all the stories collected here stand by themselves as mesmerizing works by one of the finest writers of nineteenth-century France.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>The son of a civil servant, <b>Honor� de Balzac </b>was born in 1799 in Tours, France. After attending boarding school in Vend�me, he gravitated to Paris where he worked as a legal clerk and a hack writer, using various pseudonyms, often in collaboration with other writers. Balzac turned exclusively to fiction at the age of thirty and went on to write a large number of novels and short stories set amid turbulent nineteenth-century France. He entitled his collective works The Human Comedy. Along with Victor Hugo and Dumas p�re and fils, Balzac was one of the pillars of French romantic literature. He died in 1850, shortly after his marriage to the Polish countess Evelina Hanska, his lover of eighteen years.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>The Noise of Time: A novel</h2><p>A compact masterpiece dedicated to the Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich: Julian Barnes&#x2019;s first novel since his best-selling, Man Booker Prize&#x2013;winning <i>The Sense of an Ending</i>.<br><br> In 1936, Shostakovich, just thirty, fears for his livelihood and his life. Stalin, hitherto a distant figure, has taken a sudden interest in his work and denounced his latest opera. Now, certain he will be exiled to Siberia (or, more likely, executed on the spot), Shostakovich reflects on his predicament, his personal history, his parents, various women and wives, his children&#x2014;and all who are still alive themselves hang in the balance of his fate. And though a stroke of luck prevents him from becoming yet another casualty of the Great Terror, for decades to come he will be held fast under the thumb of despotism: made to represent Soviet values at a cultural conference in New York City, forced into joining the Party and compelled, constantly, to weigh appeasing those in power against the integrity of his music. Barnes elegantly guides us through the trajectory of Shostakovich&#x2019;s career, at the same time illuminating the tumultuous evolution of the Soviet Union. The result is both a stunning portrait of a relentlessly fascinating man and a brilliant exploration of the meaning of art and its place in society.</p><p><b>JULIAN BARNES</b> is the author of twenty previous books including, most recently, <i>Keeping an Eye Open: Essays on Art</i>.

He lives in London.<br><br> www.julianbarnes.comAnd so, it had all begun, very precisely, on the morning of the 28th of January 1936, in Arkhangelsk. He had been invited to perform his first piano concerto with the local orchestra under Viktor Kubatsky; the two of them had also played his new cello sonata. It had gone well. The next morning he went to the railway station to buy a copy of <i>Pravda. </i>He had looked at the front page briefly, then turned to the next two. It was, as he would later put it, the most memorable day of his life. And a date he chose to mark each year until his death.<br><br>Except that&#x2014;as his mind obstinately argued back&#x2014;nothing ever begins as precisely as that. It began in different places, and in different minds. The true starting point might have been his own fame. Or his opera. Or it might have been Stalin, who, being infallible, was therefore responsible for everything. Or it could have been caused by something as simple as the layout of an orchestra. Indeed, that might finally be the best way of looking at it: a composer first denounced and humiliated, later arrested and shot, all because of the layout of an orchestra.<br><br>If it all began elsewhere, and in the minds of others, then perhaps he could blame Shakespeare, for having written <i>Macbeth. </i>Or Leskov for Russifying it into <i>Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk. </i>No, none of that. It was, self-evidently, his own fault for having written the piece that offended. It was his opera&#x2019;s fault for being such a success&#x2014;at home and abroad&#x2014;it had aroused the curiosity of the Kremlin. It was Stalin&#x2019;s fault because he would have inspired and approved the <i>Pravda </i>editorial&#x2014;perhaps even written it himself: there were enough grammatical errors to suggest the pen of one whose mistakes could never be corrected. It was also Stalin&#x2019;s fault for imagining himself a patron and connoisseur of the arts in the first place. He was known never to miss a performance of <i>Boris Godunov </i>at the Bolshoi. He was almost as keen on <i>Prince Igor </i>and Rimsky-Korsakov&#x2019;s <i>Sadko. </i>Why should Stalin not want to hear this acclaimed new opera, <i>Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk</i>?<br><br>And so, the composer was instructed to attend a performance of his own work on the 26th of January 1936. Comrade Stalin would be there; also Comrades Molotov, Mikoyan and Zhdanov. They took their places in the government box. Which had the misfortune to be situated immediately above the percussion and the brass. Sections which in <i>Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk </i>were not scored to behave in a modest and self-effacing fashion.<br><br>He remembered looking across from the director&#x2019;s box, where he was seated, to the government box. Stalin was hidden behind a small curtain, an absent presence to whom the other distinguished comrades would sycophantically turn, knowing that they were themselves observed. Given the occasion, both conductor and orchestra were understandably nervous. In the entr&#x2019;acte before Katerina&#x2019;s wedding, the woodwind and brass suddenly took it upon themselves to play more loudly than he had scored. And then it was like a virus spreading through each section. If the conductor noticed, he was powerless. Louder and louder the orchestra became; and every time the percussion and brass roared fortissimo beneath them&#x2014;loud enough to knock out windowpanes&#x2014;Comrades Mikoyan and Zhdanov would shudder theatrically, turn to the figure behind the curtain and make some mocking remark. When the audience looked up to the government box at the start of the fourth act, they saw that it had been vacated.<br><br> After the performance, he had collected his briefcase and gone straight to the Northern Station to catch the train for Arkhangelsk. He remembered thinking that the government box had been specially reinforced with steel plates, to protect its occupants against assassination. But that there was no such cladding to the director&#x2019;s box. He was not yet thirty, and his wife was five months pregnant at the time.<br> &nbsp;<br> 1936: he had always been superstitious about leap years. Like many people, he believed that they brought bad luck.<br><br> #<br><br> Those who did not know him, and who followed music only from a distance, probably imagined that this had been his first setback. That the brilliant nineteen-year-old whose First Symphony was quickly taken up by Bruno Walter, then by Toscanini and Klemperer, had known nothing but a clear, clean decade of success since that premiere in 1926. And such people, perhaps aware that fame often leads to vanity and self-importance, might open their <i>Pravda </i>and agree that composers could easily stray from writing the kind of music people wanted to hear. And further, since all composers were employed by the state, that it was the state&#x2019;s duty, if they offended, to intervene and draw them back into greater harmony with their audience. This sounded entirely reasonable, didn&#x2019;t it?<br><br>Except that they had practised sharpening their claws on his soul from the beginning: while he was still at the Conservatoire a group of Leftist fellow students had tried to have him dismissed and his stipend removed. Except that the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians and similar cultural organisations had campaigned from their inception against what he stood for; or rather, what they thought he stood for. They were determined to break the bourgeois stranglehold on the arts. So workers must be trained to become composers, and all music must be instantly comprehensible and pleasing to the masses. Tchaikovsky was decadent, and the slightest experimentation condemned as &#x201c;formalism.&#x201d;<br><br>Except that as early as 1929 he had been officially denounced, told that his music was &#x201c;straying from the main road of Soviet art,&#x201d; and sacked from his post at the Choreographic Technical College. Except that in the same year Misha Kvadri, the dedicatee of his First Symphony, became the first of his friends and associates to be arrested and shot.<br><br> Except that in 1932, when the Party dissolved the independent organisations and took charge of all cultural matters, this had resulted not in a taming of arrogance, bigotry and ignorance, rather in a systematic concentration of them. And if the plan to take a worker from the coal face and turn him into a composer of symphonies did not exactly come to pass, something of the reverse happened. A composer was expected to increase his output just as a coal miner was, and his music was expected to warm hearts just as a miner&#x2019;s coal warmed bodies. Bureaucrats assessed musical output as they did other categories of output; there were established norms, and deviations from those norms.<br> &nbsp;<br> #<br> &nbsp;<br> At Arkhangelsk railway station, opening <i>Pravda </i>with chilled fingers, he had found on page three a headline identifying and condemning deviance: muddle instead of music. He determined at once to return home via Moscow, where he would seek advice. On the train, as the frozen landscape passed, he reread the article for the fifth and sixth times. Initially, he had been shocked as much for his opera as for himself: after such a denunciation, <i>Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk </i>could not possibly continue at the Bolshoi. For the last two years, it had been applauded everywhere&#x2014;from New York to Cleveland, from Sweden to Argentina. In Moscow and Leningrad, it had pleased not just the public and the critics, but also the political commissars. At the time of the 17th Party Congress its performances had been listed as part of the Moscow district&#x2019;s official output, which aimed to compete with the production quotas of the Donbass coal miners.<br><br>All this meant nothing now: his opera was to be put down like a yapping dog which had suddenly displeased its master. He tried to analyse the different elements of the attack as clearheadedly as possible. First, his opera&#x2019;s very success, especially abroad, was turned against it. Only a few months before, <i>Pravda </i>had patriotically reported the work&#x2019;s American premiere at the Metropolitan Opera. Now the same paper knew that <i>Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk </i>had only succeeded outside the Soviet Union because it was &#x201c;non-political and confusing,&#x201d; and because it &#x201c;tickled the perverted taste of the bourgeois with its fidgety, neurotic music.&#x201d;<br><br>Next, and linked to this, was what he thought of as government-box criticism, an articulation of those smirks and yawns and sycophantic turnings towards the hidden Stalin. So he read how his music &#x201c;quacks and grunts and growls&#x201d;; how its &#x201c;nervous, convulsive and spasmodic&#x201d; nature derived from jazz; how it replaced singing with &#x201c;shrieking.&#x201d; The opera had clearly been scribbled down in order to please the &#x201c;effete,&#x201d; who had lost all &#x201c;wholesome taste&#x201d; for music, preferring &#x201c;a confused stream of sound.&#x201d; As for the libretto, it deliberately concentrated on the most sordid parts of Leskov&#x2019;s tale: the result was &#x201c;coarse, primitive and vulgar.&#x201d;<br><br>But his sins were political as well. So the anonymous analysis by someone who knew as much about music as a pig knows about oranges was decorated with those familiar, vinegar-soaked labels. Petit-bourgeois, formalist, Meyerholdist, Leftist. The composer had written not an opera but an anti-opera, with music deliberately turned inside out. He had drunk from the same poisoned source which produced &#x201c;Leftist distortion in painting, poetry, teaching and science.&#x201d; In case it needed spelling out&#x2014;and it always did&#x2014;Leftism was contrasted with &#x201c;real art, real science and real literature.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Those that have ears will hear,&#x201d; he always liked to say. But even the stone deaf couldn&#x2019;t fail to hear what &#x201c;Muddle Instead of Music&#x201d; was saying, and guess its likely consequences. There were three phrases which aimed not just at his theoretical misguidedness but at his very person. &#x201c;The composer apparently never considered the problem of what the Soviet audience looks for and expects in music.&#x201d; That was enough to take away his membership in the Union of Composers. &#x201c;The dan�ger of this trend to Soviet music is clear.&#x201d; That was enough to take away his ability to compose and perform. And finally: &#x201c;It is a game of clever ingenuity that may end very badly.&#x201d; That was enough to take away his life.</p><h2>The Gospel of John (Sacra Pagina Series, Volume 4)</h2><p><p>No other book of the New Testament has attracted as much attention from commentators as the Fourth Gospel.

Today Americans are lamenting the erosion of his ideal. What happened in the intervening centuries? Daniel Kemmis argues that our loss of capacity for public life (which impedes our ability to resolve crucial issues) parallels our loss of a sense of place. A renewed sense of inhabitation, he maintains &#x2015;of community rooted in place and of people dwelling in that place in a practiced way&#x2015;can shape politics into a more cooperative and more humanly satisfying enterprise, producing better people, better communities, and better places.</p> <p>The author emphasizes the importance of place by analyzing problems and possibilities of public life in a particular place&#x2015; those northern states whose settlement marked the end of the old frontier. National efforts to &#x201c;keep citizens apart&#x201d; by encouraging them to develop open country and rely upon impersonal, procedural methods for public problems have bred stalemate, frustration, and alienation. As alternatives he suggests how western patterns of inhabitation might engender a more cooperative, face-to-face practice of public life.</p> <p><em>Community and the Politics of Place</em> also examines our ambivalence about the relationship between cities and rural areas and about the role of corporations in public life. The book offers new insight into the relationship between politics and economics and addresses the question of whether the nation-state is an appropriate entity for the practice of either discipline. The author draws upon the growing literature of civic republicanism for both a language and a vantage point from which to address problems in American public life, but he criticizes that literature for its failure to consider place.</p> <p>Though its focus on a single region lends concreteness to its discussions, <em>Community and the Politics of Place</em> promotes a better understanding of the quality of public life today in all regions of the United States.</p></p><p><p><strong>Daniel Kemmis</strong>, a senior fellow at the Northern Light Research and Education Institute (Missoula, Montana), is a former minority leader and speaker of the Montana House of Representatives and is presently the mayor of Missoula.</p></p><h2>The Underground Girls of Kabul: In Search of a Hidden Resistance in Afghanistan</h2><p><p><b>An investigative journalist uncovers a hidden custom in Afghanistan&nbsp;that will transform your understanding of what it means to grow up as a girl.</b><br><br>In Afghanistan, a culture ruled almost entirely by men, the birth of a son is cause for celebration and the arrival of a daughter is often mourned as misfortune. A <i>bacha posh </i>(literally translated from Dari as&nbsp;&#x201c;dressed up like a boy&#x201d;) is a third kind of child--a girl temporarily raised as a boy and presented as such to the outside world. Jenny Nordberg, the reporter who broke the story of this phenomenon for the <i>New York Times</i>, constructs a powerful and moving account of those secretly living on the other side of a deeply segregated society where women have almost no rights and little freedom. <br><i><br>The Underground Girls of Kabul </i>is anchored by vivid characters who bring this remarkable story to life: Azita, a female parliamentarian who sees no other choice but to turn her fourth daughter Mehran into a boy; Zahra, the tomboy teenager who struggles with puberty and refuses her parents&#x2019; attempts to turn her back into a girl; Shukria, now a married mother of three after living for twenty years as a man; and Nader, who prays with Shahed, the undercover female police officer, as they both remain in male disguise as adults. <br><br>At the heart of this emotional narrative is a new perspective on the extreme sacrifices of Afghan women and girls against the violent backdrop of America&#x2019;s longest war. Divided into four parts, the book follows those born as the unwanted sex in Afghanistan, but who&nbsp;live as the socially favored gender through childhood and puberty, only to later be forced into marriage and childbirth. <i>The Underground Girls of Kabul</i> charts their dramatic life cycles, while examining our own history and the parallels to subversive actions of people who live under oppression everywhere.</p></p><p><b>JENNY NORDBERG</b> is an award-winning journalist based in New York.

Then she turns to her sister. She agrees. Yes, it is true. She can confirm it.<br><br>They are two ten-year-old identical girls, each with black hair, squirrel eyes, and a few small freckles. Moments ago, we danced to my iPod set to shuffle as we waited for their mother to finish a phone conversation in the other room. We passed the headphones between us, showing off our best moves. Though I failed to match their elaborate hip rolls, some of my most inspired sing-along was met with approval. It actually sounded pretty good bouncing off the ice-cold cement walls of the apartment in the Soviet-built maze that is home to a chunk of Kabul's small middle class.<br><br>Now we sit on the gold-embroidered sofa, where the twins have set up a tea service consisting of glass mugs and a pump thermos on a silver-plated tray. The mehman khana is the most opulent room in an Afghan home, meant to show off the wealth and good moral character of its owners. Cassette tapes with Koran verses and peach-colored fabric flowers sit on a corner table where a crack has been soldered with Scotch tape. The twin sisters, their legs neatly folded underneath them on the sofa, are a little offended by my lack of reaction to their big reveal. Twin number two leans forward: "It's true. He is our little sister."<br><br>I smile at them, and nod again. "Yes." Sure.<br><br>A framed picture on a side table shows their brother posing in a V-neck sweater and tie, with his grinning, mustached father. It is the only photo on display in the living room. His oldest daughters speak a shaky but enthusiastic English, picked up from textbooks and satellite television from a dish on the balcony. We just have a language barrier here, perhaps. <br><br>"Okay," I say, wanting to be friendly. "I understand. Your sister. Now, what is your favorite color, Benafsha?"<br><br>She goes back and forth between red and purple before passing the question to her sister, where it gets equally serious consideration. The twins, both dressed in orange cardigans and green pants, seem to do most things in perfect girly synchronicity. Their bobbing heads are topped with glittery hair scrunchies, and only when one speaks will the other's scrunchie be still for a few seconds. Those moments are a beginner's chance to tell them apart: A small birthmark on Beheshta's cheek is the key. Beheshta means "flower"; Benafsha, "paradise."<br><br>"I want to be a teacher when I grow up," Beheshta volunteers for our next topic.<br><br>When it becomes each of the twins' turns to ask a question, they both want to know the same thing: Am I married?<br><br>My response mystifies them, since--as they point out--I am very old. I am even a few years older than their mother, who at thirty-three is a married mother of four. The twins have another sister, too, in addition to their little brother. Their mother is also in the national parliament, I say to the twins. So there are many things I am not, compared to her. They seem to appreciate that framing.<br><br>Their brother suddenly appears in the doorway.<br><br>Mehran, age six, has a tanned, round face, deep dimples, eyebrows that go up and down as he grimaces, and a wide gap between his front teeth. His hair is as black as that of his sisters, but short and spiky. In a tight red denim shirt and blue pants, chin forward, hands on hips, he swaggers confidently into the room, looking directly at me, and pointing a toy gun in my face. Then he pulls the trigger and exclaims his greeting: phow. When I fail to die or shoot back, he takes out a plastic superhero from his back pocket. The wingman has blond hair, shiny white teeth, two gun belts slung across his bulging chest, and is armed with a machine gun. Mehran says something in Dari to the figurine and then listens intently to him. They seem to agree: The assault has been a success.<br><br>Benafsha comes alive at my side, seeing the chance to finally prove her point. She waves her arms to call her brother's attention: "Tell her, Mehran. Tell her you are our sister."<br><br>The corners of Mehran's mouth turn downward. He sticks his tongue out in a grimace before bolting, almost crashing, into his mother as she walks into the room.<br><br>Azita's eyes are lined with black kohl, and she wears a little bit of blush. Or perhaps it is the effect of having had a cell phone pressed to her ear. She is ready now, she exclaims in my direction. To tell me what I came to ask about--what it is like, almost a decade into America's longest war and one of the largest foreign aid efforts of a generation, to be an Afghan woman here.<br>When we first meet, on this day, I am researching a television piece on Afghan women and Azita has been a member of the country's fairly new parliament for four years. Elected to the Wolesi Jirga, one of the legislative branches installed a few years after the 2001 defeat of the Taliban, she had promised her rural voters in Badghis province that she would direct more of the foreign-aid influx to their poor, far-flung corner of Afghanistan.<br><br>The parliament she entered was heavily populated with drug kingpins and warlords and seemed to be in a state of paralysis due to deeply entrenched corruption, but it was at least an attempt at democracy that many Afghans expressed hope for. It followed many forms of failed governance during the last century: absolute monarchy, communism, and an Islamic emirate under the Taliban. Or no government at all in times of civil war. <br><br>As some foreign diplomats and aid workers around Kabul came to know Azita as an educated female parliamentarian who not only spoke Dari, Pashto, Urdu, and Russian, but also English, and who seemed relatively liberal, invitations to events poured in from the outside world. She was flown to several European countries and to Yale University in the United States, where she spoke of life under the Taliban.<br><br>It was not unusual for Azita to invite foreigners to her rented home in Macroyan, either to show her version of normal life in a Kabul neighborhood. Here, laundry flutters on the balconies of dirt-gray four-story buildings, interrupted by the occasional patch of greenery, and in the early mornings, women gather at the hole-in-the-wall bakeries while men perform stiff gymnastic exercises on the football field. Azita takes pride in being a host and showing herself off as an exception to the way Afghan women are portrayed in the outside world--as secluded inside their homes, with little connection to society, often illiterate and under the spell of demonizing husbands who do not allow them any daylight. And definitely not receiving visits from farangee, or foreigners, as the British were once dubbed by Afghans. These days, foreigners usually go under amrican, regardless of their passport.<br><br>Azita enjoys demonstrating her running water, the electricity, the television set in her bedroom; all paid for with money she has made as the breadwinner of the house. She knows that impresses foreigners. Especially female foreigners. With her glowing cheeks, sharp features, and military-grade posture, elegantly draped in black fabric from head to toe, and exuding a warm scent of musk mixed with something sweet, Azita does look different from Afghanistan's majority of women. At five feet six--perhaps a little taller in her pointy size-eleven sling-back heels--she even towers over some visitors. Those usually arrive in more practical shoes, as if on a trek somewhere.<br>On the topic of progress for women since 2001, Azita expresses little satisfaction to visiting foreigners, of which I am just the latest: Yes, more women are seen on the streets of Kabul and a few other larger cities than when the Taliban was in power, and more girls are enrolled in school, but just as in earlier eras when reforms were attempted, most progress for women is limited to the capital and a handful of other urban areas. Much of what the Taliban had banned and decreed regarding women is still effectively law in large parts of this mostly illiterate country, enforced by conservative tradition. In many provinces, burkas are still commonplace, and women rarely work or leave the house without their husbands. The majority of marriages are still forced, honor killings are not unusual, and any involvement of the justice system in a rape case usually means that only the victim goes to jail, charged with adultery or with having had premarital sex--unless she, as a commonly imposed solution, is forced to marry her rapist. Women burn themselves to death using cooking oil to escape domestic abuse here, and daughters are still a viable, informal currency used by fathers to pay off debts and settle disputes. <br><br>Azita is one of few women with a voice, but to many, she remains a provocation, since her life is different from that of most women in Afghanistan and a threat to those who subjugate them. In her words: "If you go to the remote areas of Afghanistan, you will see nothing has changed in women's lives. They are still like servants. Like animals. We have a long time before the woman is considered a human in this society."<br><br>Azita pushes her emerald green head scarf back to reveal a short black ponytail, and rubs her hair. I shake off my scarf, too, and let it fall down on my neck. She looks at me for a moment, where we sit in her bedroom. "I never want my daughters to suffer in the ways I have suffered. I had to kill many of my dreams. I have four daughters. I am very happy for that."<br><br>Four daughters. Only four daughters? What is going on in this family? I hold my breath for a moment, hoping Azita will take the lead and help me understand.<br><br>And she does.<br><br>"Would you like to see our family album?"<br>We move back into the living room, where she pulls out two albums from under a rickety little desk. The children look at these photos often. They tell the story of how Azita's family came to be.<br><br>First: a series of shots from Azita's engagement party in the summer of 1997. Azita's first cousin, whom she is to marry, is young and lanky. On his face, small patches of hair are still struggling to meet in the middle as a full beard; a requirement under Taliban rule at that time. The fiance wears a turban and a brown wool vest over a traditional white peran tonban--a long shirt and loose pants. None of the one hundred or so guests are smiling. By Afghan standards, where a party can number more than a thousand, it was a small and unimpressive gathering. It is a snapshot of the city meeting the village. Azita is the elite-educated daughter of a Kabul University professor. Her husband-to-be: the illiterate son of a farmer.<br><br>A few staged moments are captured. The fiance, attempting to feed his future wife some of the pink and yellow cake. She turns her head away. At nineteen, Azita is a thinner and more serious version of her later self, in a cobalt blue silk caftan with rounded shoulder pads. Her fingernails have been painted a bright red to match crimson lips, set off by a white-powdered face that reads as a mask. Her hair is a hard, sprayed bird's nest. In another shot, her future husband offers her a celebratory goblet from which she is expected to drink. She stares into the camera. Her matte, powdery face is streaked with vertical lines running from dark brown eyes.<br><br>A few album pages later, the twins pose with Azita's mother, a woman with high cheekbones and a strong nose in a deeply lined face. Both Benafsha and Beheshta blow kisses onto their bibi-jan, who still lives with their grandfather in the northwest of Afghanistan. Soon, a third little girl makes her appearance in the photos. Middle sister Mehrangis has pigtails and a slightly rounder face. She poses next to the twin mini-Azitas, who suddenly look very grown up in their white ruffle dresses.<br><br>Azita flips the page: Nowruz, the Persian New Year, in 2005. Four little girls in cream-colored dresses. All ordered by size. The shortest has a bow in her hair. It is Mehran. Azita puts her finger on the picture. Without looking up, she says: "You know my youngest is also a girl, yes? We dress her like a boy."<br><br>I glance in the direction of Mehran, who has been skidding around the periphery as we have talked. She has hopped into another chair and is talking to the plastic figurine again.<br><br>"They gossip about my family. When you have no sons, it is a big missing, and everyone feels sad for you."<br><br>Azita says this as if it is a simple explanation. <br><br>Having at least one son is mandatory for good standing and reputation here. A family is not only incomplete without one; in a country lacking rule of law, it is also seen as weak and vulnerable. So it is incumbent upon every married woman to quickly bear a son-it is her absolute purpose in life, and if she does not fulfill it, there is clearly something wrong with her in the eyes of others. She could be dismissed as a dokhtar zai, or "she who only brings daughters." Still, this is not as grave an insult as what an entirely childless woman could be called--a sanda or khoshk, meaning "dry" in Dari. But a woman who cannot birth a son in a patrilineal culture is--in the eyes of society and often herself--fundamentally flawed.<br><br>The literacy rate is no more than 10 percent in most areas, and many unfounded truths swirl around without being challenged. Among them is the commonly held belief that a woman can choose the sex of her unborn baby simply by making up her mind about it. As a consequence, a woman's inability to bear sons does not elicit much sympathy. Instead, she is condemned both by society and her own husband as someone who has just not desired a son strongly enough. Women, too, often resort to blaming their own bodies and weak minds for failing to deliver sons.<br><br>The character flaws often add up about such a woman in the eyes of others: She is surely difficult and obnoxious. Perhaps even evil. The fact that the father actually determines the sex of a child, as the male sperm carries the chromosome makeup for each child and determines whether a boy or a girl will be born, is unknown to most.</p><h2>Color in Interior Design</h2><p><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b><b><br></b><br><b><br></b><br><b>Create dazzling color schemes for any indoor space&nbsp;</b><br>You'll quickly sharpen your color skills--and open the door to a more rewarding and profitable career with John F.

My name is Marcus Yallow, but back when this story starts, I was going by w1n5t0n. Pronounced &#x201c;Winston.&#x201d;</p><p>Not pronounced &#x201c;Double-you-one-enn-five-tee-zero-enn&#x201d;&#x2014; unless you&#x2019;re a clueless disciplinary officer who&#x2019;s far enough behind the curve that you still call the Internet &#x201c;the information superhighway.&#x201d;</p><p>I know just such a clueless person, and his name is Fred Benson, one of three vice-principals at Cesar Chavez. He&#x2019;s a sucking chest wound of a human being. But if you&#x2019;re going to have a jailer, better a clueless one than one who&#x2019;s really on the ball.</p><p>&#x201c;Marcus Yallow,&#x201c; he said over the PA one Friday morning. The PA isn&#x2019;t very good to begin with, and when you combine that with Benson&#x2019;s habitual mumble, you get something that sounds more like someone struggling to digest a bad burrito than a school announcement. But human beings are good at picking their names out of audio confusion&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a survival trait.</p><p>I grabbed my bag and folded my laptop three-quarters shut&#x2014;I didn&#x2019;t want to blow my downloads&#x2014;and got ready for</p><p>the inevitable.</p><p>&#x201c;Report to the administration office immediately.&#x201d;</p><p>My social studies teacher, Ms. Galvez, rolled her eyes at me and I rolled my eyes back at her. The Man was always coming down on me, just because I go through school firewalls like wet kleenex, spoof the gait-recognition software, and nuke the snitch chips they track us with. Galvez is a good type, anyway, never holds that against me (especially when I&#x2019;m helping get with her webmail so she can talk to her brother who&#x2019;s stationed in Iraq).</p><p>My boy Darryl gave me a smack on the ass as I walked past. I&#x2019;ve known Darryl since we were still in diapers and escaping from play-school, and I&#x2019;ve been getting him into and out of trouble the whole time. I raised my arms over my head like a prizefighter and made my exit from Social Studies and began the perp-walk to the office.</p><p>I was halfway there when my phone went. That was another no-no&#x2014;phones are muy prohibido at Chavez High&#x2014;but why should that stop me? I ducked into the toilet and shut myself in the middle stall (the farthest stall is always grossest because so many people head straight for it, hoping to escape the smell and the squick&#x2014;the smart money and good hygiene is down the middle). I checked the phone&#x2014;my home PC had sent it an email to tell it that there was something new up on Harajuku Fun Madness, which happens to be the best game ever invented.</p><p>I grinned. Spending Fridays at school was teh suck anyway, and I was glad of the excuse to make my escape.</p><p>I ambled the rest of the way to Benson&#x2019;s office and tossed him a wave as I sailed through the door.</p><p>&#x201c;If it isn&#x2019;t Double-you-one-enn-five-tee-zero-enn,&#x201c; he said. Fredrick Benson&#x2014;Social Security number 545&#x2013;03&#x2013;2343, date of birth August 15 1962, mother&#x2019;s maiden name Di Bona, hometown Petaluma&#x2014;is a lot taller than me. I&#x2019;m a runty 5&#x2019;8&#x201d;, while he stands 6&#x2019;7&#x201d;, and his college basketball days are far enough behind him that his chest muscles have turned into saggy man-boobs that were painfully obvious through his freebie dot-com polo shirts. He always looks like he&#x2019;s about to slam-dunk your ass, and he&#x2019;s really into raising his voice for dramatic effect. Both these start to lose their efficacy with repeated application.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry, nope,&#x201c; I said. &#x201c;I never heard of this R2D2 character of yours.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;W1n5t0n,&#x201c; he said, spelling it out again. He gave me a hairy eyeball and waited for me to wilt. Of course it was my handle, and had been for years. It was the identity I used when I was posting on message boards where I was making my contributions to the field of applied security research. You know, like sneaking out of school and disabling the minder-tracer on my phone. But he didn&#x2019;t know that this was my handle. Only a small number of people did, and I trusted them all to the end of the earth.</p><p>&#x201c;Um, not ringing any bells,&#x201c; I said. I&#x2019;d done some pretty cool stuff around school using that handle&#x2014;I was very proud of my work on snitch-tag killers&#x2014;and if he could link the two identities, I&#x2019;d be in trouble. No one at school ever called me w1n5t0n or even Winston. Not even my pals. It was Marcus or nothing.</p><p>Benson settled down behind his desk and tapped his class ring nervously on his blotter. He did this whenever things started to go bad for him. Poker players call stuff like this a &#x201c;tell&#x201d;&#x2014; something that lets you know what&#x2019;s going on in the other guy&#x2019;s head. I knew Benson&#x2019;s tells backwards and forwards.</p><p>&#x201c;Marcus, I hope you realize how serious this is.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I will just as soon as you explain what this is, sir.&#x201d; I always say &#x201c;sir&#x201d; to authority figures when I&#x2019;m messing with them. It&#x2019;s my own tell.</p><p>He shook his head at me and looked down, another tell. Any second now, he was going to start shouting at me. &#x201c;Listen, kiddo! It&#x2019;s time you came to grips with the fact that we know about what you&#x2019;ve been doing, and that we&#x2019;re not going to be lenient about it. You&#x2019;re going to be lucky if you&#x2019;re not expelled before this meeting is through. Do you want to graduate?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Benson, you still haven&#x2019;t explained what the problem is&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>He slammed his hand down on the desk and then pointed his finger at me. &#x201c;The problem, Mr. Yallow, is that you&#x2019;ve been engaged in criminal conspiracy to subvert this school&#x2019;s security system, and you have supplied security countermeasures to your fellow students. You know that we expelled Graciella Uriarte last week for using one of your devices.&#x201d; Uriarte had gotten a bad rap. She&#x2019;d bought a radio-jammer from a head shop near the 16th Street BART station and it had set off the countermeasures in the school hallway. Not my doing, but I felt for her.</p><p>&#x201c;And you think I&#x2019;m involved in that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We have reliable intelligence indicating that you are w1n5t0n&#x201d;&#x2014;again, he spelled it out, and I began to wonder if he hadn&#x2019;t figured out that the 1 was an I and the 5 was an S. &#x201c;We know that this w1n5t0n character is responsible for the theft of last year&#x2019;s standardized tests.&#x201d; That actually hadn&#x2019;t been me, but it was a sweet hack, and it was kind of flattering to hear it attributed to me. &#x201c;And therefore liable for several years in prison unless you cooperate with me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You have &#x2018;reliable intelligence&#x2019;? I&#x2019;d like to see it.&#x201d;</p><p>He glowered at me. &#x201c;Your attitude isn&#x2019;t going to help you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If there&#x2019;s evidence, sir, I think you should call the police and turn it over to them. It sounds like this is a very serious matter, and I wouldn&#x2019;t want to stand in the way of a proper investigation by the duly constituted authorities.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You want me to call the police.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And my parents, I think. That would be for the best.&#x201d;</p><p>We stared at each other across the desk. He&#x2019;d clearly expected me to fold the second he dropped the bomb on me. I don&#x2019;t fold. I have a trick for staring down people like Benson. I look slightly to the left of their heads, and think about the lyrics to old Irish folk songs, the kind with three hundred verses. It makes me look perfectly composed and unworried.</p><p>And the wing was on the bird and the bird was on the egg and the egg was in the nest and the nest was on the leaf and the leaf was on the twig and the twig was on the branch and the branch was on the limb and the limb was in the tree and the tree was in the bog&#x2014;the bog down in the valley-oh! High-ho the rattlin&#x2019; bog, the bog down in the valley-oh&#x2014;</p><p>&#x201c;You can return to class now,&#x201c; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call on you once the police are ready to speak to you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you going to call them now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The procedure for calling in the police is complicated. I&#x2019;d hoped that we could settle this fairly and quickly, but since you insist&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can wait while you call them is all,&#x201c; I said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mind.&#x201d;</p><p>He tapped his ring again and I braced for the blast.</p><p>&#x201c;Go!&#x201d; he yelled. &#x201c;Get the hell out of my office, you miserable little&#x2014;&#x201d;I got out, keeping my expression neutral. He wasn&#x2019;t going to call the cops. If he&#x2019;d had enough evidence to go to the police with, he would have called them in the first place. He hated my guts. I figured he&#x2019;d heard some unverified gossip and hoped to spook me into confirming it.</p><p>I moved down the corridor lightly and sprightly, keeping my gait even and measured for the gait-recognition cameras. These had been installed only a year before, and I loved them for their sheer idiocy.

Andrew Grieg</h2><p>For many years Andrew Greig saw the poet Norman MacCaig as a father figure. Months before his death, MacCaig&#39;s enigmatic final request to Greig was that he fish for him at the Loch of the Green Corrie; the location, even the real name of his destination was more mysterious still. His search took in days of outdoor living, meetings, and fishing with friends in the remote hill lochs of far North-West Scotland. It led, finally, to the waters of the Green Corrie, which would come to reflect Greig&#39;s own life, his thoughts on poetry, geology and land ownership in the Highlands and the ambiguous roles of whisky, love and male friendship. At the Loch of the Green Corrie is a richly atmospheric narrative, a celebration of losing and recovering oneself in a unique landscape, the consideration of a particular culture, and a homage to a remarkable poet and his world.</p><p>Andrew Greig is the author of six books of poetry, two mountaineering books; two non-fiction books and six novels. He has been shortlisted for the Walter Scott Prize, and won the Saltire and the Scottish Book of the Year awards. He lives in Orkney and Edinburgh with his wife, the novelist Lesley Glaister.&#39;This is nature writing of the first order ... a luminous hymn to life and love and our land&#39; * Scotland on Sunday * &#39;Moving and utterly memorable, a triumph&#39; * The Times * &#39;A ruminative, beautifully written book that is at once a biography of MacCaig, an account of a journey in North West Scotland and a captivating memoir of Greig&#39;s life as a poet, Himalayan climber and fisherman&#39; * Sunday Times * &#39;It is completely absorbing ... and the intense self-scrutiny is matched by landscape writing worthy of Robert Louis Stevenson himself&#39; * Guardian * &#39;If you have a desire to luxuriate in the most beautiful use of the English language borne along by the love of one gifted poet for a recognized master of melancholy, then this is the book for you.

Despite invasion by a series of British, Spanish and Napoleonic armies, their twelve-year struggle led to the creation of Haiti, the first independent black republic outside Africa. Only three years later, the British and Americans ended the Atlantic slave trade. In this example of vivid, committed and empathetic historical analysis, C.L.R. James illuminates these epoch-making events. He explores the appalling economic realities of the Caribbean economy, the roots of the world&#39;s only successful slave revolt and the utterly extraordinary former slave - Toussaint L&#39;Overture -who led them. Explicitly written as part of the fight to end colonialism in Africa, &#34;The Black Jacobins&#34; puts the slaves themselves centre stage, boldly forging their own destiny against nearly impossible odds. It remains one of the essential texts for understanding the Caribbean - and the region&#39;s inextricable links with Europe, Africa and the Americas.</p><p>In 1789 the French colony of Saint Domingue was the most profitable real estate in the world. These profits came at a price: while its sugar plantations supplied two-thirds of France's overseas trade, they also stimulated the greatest individual market for the slave trade. The slaves were brutally treated and died in great numbers, prompting a never-ending influx of new slaves.<p> The French Revolution sent waves all the way across the Atlantic, dividing the colony's white population in 1791. The elites remained royalist, while the bourgeoisie embraced the revolutionary ideals. The slaves seized the moment and in the confusion rebelled en masse against their owners. The Haitian Slave Revolt had begun. When it ended in 1803, Saint Domingue had become Haiti, the first independent nation in the Caribbean.</p><p> C.L.R. James tells the story of the revolt and the events leading up to it in his masterpiece, <i>The Black Jacobins</i>. James's personal beliefs infuse his narrative: in his preface to a 1962 edition of the book, he asserts that , when written in 1938, it was "intended to stimulate the coming emancipation of Africa." James writes passionately about the horrific lives of the slaves and of the man who rose up and led them--a semiliterate slave named Fran�ois-Dominique Toussaint L'Ouverture. As James notes, however, "Toussaint did not make the revolution. It was the revolution that made Toussaint." </p><p> With its appendix, "From Toussaint L'Ouverture to Fidel Castro," <i>The Black Jacobins</i> provides an excellent window into the Haitian Revolution and the worldwide repercussions it caused. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p>&#34;Detailed, richly documented and dramatically written.&#34;--The New York Times</p><h2>The Woman At Otowi Crossing</h2><p><p>Based on the real life of Edith Warner, who ran a tearoom at Otowi Crossing, just below Los Alamos, <i>The Woman at Otowi Crossing</i> is the story of Helen Chalmer, a person in tune with her adopted environment and her neighbors in the nearby Indian pueblo and also a friend of the first atomic scientists. The secret evolution of atomic research is a counterpoint to her psychic development. <br><br> In keeping with its tradition of allowing the best of its list to thrive, Ohio University Press/Swallow Press is particularly proud to reissue <i>The Woman at Otowi Crossing</i> by best-selling author Frank Waters. This new edition features an introduction by Professor Thomas J. Lyon and a foreword by the author's widow, Barbara Waters. <br><br> The story is quintessential Waters: a parable for the potentially destructive materialism of the mid-twentieth century. The antidote is Helen Chalmer's ability to understand a deeper truth of her being; beyond the Western notion of selfhood, beyond the sense of a personality distinct from the rest, she experiences a new and wider awareness. <br><br> The basis for an opera of the same name, <i>The Woman at Otowi Crossing</i> is the powerful story of the crossing of cultures and lives: a fable for our times.</p></p><p>This reissued classic by one of the Southwest's finest writers tells the story of Helen Chalmers and her psychic and physical connections to the secret development of the atomic bomb. Helen's spiritual journey, based on the life of Edith Warner, begins the day that she discovers she has cancer. Because of the psychic powers that she gradually harnesses, she becomes a myth. Helen evolves into the Woman at Otowi Crossing--called "witch" by the Mexicans--who predicts events and thus changes the outlook of those in charge of nuclear testing. An assertion of spirit over matter takes place within her. This serves as a metaphor for the disastrous cosmic possibilities inherent in the misuse of the atom's energy. At Helen's death, the metaphor changes to the atom's radiance as a potential maker of worlds. <i>--Susan Swartwout</i><p><b>Frank Waters</b> (1902&#x2013;1995), one of the finest chroniclers of the American Southwest, wrote twenty&#x2013;eight works of fiction and nonfiction.</p></p><h2>Islamic Art and Architecture (The World of Art)</h2><p><p><strong>Covering one thousand years of history and an area stretching from the Atlantic to the borders of India and China, Robert Hillenbrand incorporates all the latest discoveries and interpretations in this authoritative guide to the arts of Islam.</strong></p> From the supreme confidence of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem to the scores of exquisite buildings of Ottoman Istanbul; from the extraordinary virtuosity of Persian painting in the fifteenth century to the vivid ceramic tradition of Ottoman Iznik&#x2015;Hillenbrand does justice to both the highlights and the ongoing evolution of the full range of Islamic arts.

But when confronted with new challenges, we need to think more broadly and adapt. When Isaac Lidsky learned that he was beginning to go blind at age thirteen, eventually losing his sight entirely by the time he was twenty-five, he initially thought that blindness would mean an end to his early success and his hopes for the future. Paradoxically, losing his sight gave him the vision to take responsibility for his reality and thrive. Lidsky graduated from Harvard College at age nineteen, served as a Supreme Court law clerk, fathered four children, and turned a failing construction subcontractor into a highly profitable business.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether we&#x2019;re blind or not, our vision is limited by our past experiences, biases, and emotions. Lidsky shows us how we can overcome paralyzing fears, avoid falling prey to our own assumptions and faulty leaps of logic, silence our inner critic, harness our strength, and live with open hearts and minds. In sharing his hard-won insights, Lidsky shows us how we too can confront life's trials with initiative, humor, and grace.<b><br></b></p><p><b>Isaac Lidsky</b> "may possess the most eclectic resume in entrepreneurship" according to <i>Inc. Magazine</i>. He played series regular "Weasel" on <i>Saved by the Bell: The New Class</i>; graduated from Harvard College at age nineteen with a degree in mathematics and computer science; graduated from Harvard Law School magna cum laude; served as a law clerk for Supreme Court Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg; argued more than a dozen appeals in federal court on behalf of the United States and never lost a case; started a tech company that sold for $230 million; transformed a struggling $15 million concrete subcontractor into an industry-leading $150 million construction services company in five years; and founded Hope for Vision, a nonprofit organization that funds the development of treatments and cures for blinding diseases. Lidsky was born with Retinitis Pigmentosa, a rare degenerative disease of the retina that caused him to gradually lose his sight. Lidsky lives in Windermere, Florida with his wife, Dorothy; their triplets, Lily Louise, Phineas, and Thaddeus; and baby Clementine.<p>CHAPTER 1</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>Seeing and Believing</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>What you don&#x2019;t know can&#x2019;t hurt you, but what you think you know certainly can.</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;When my wife, Dorothy, was a little girl, she was fascinated by her pet goldfish. Her father explained that fish swim by quickly wagging their tails to propel themselves through water. Without hesitation or doubt, Dorothy responded by informing him that fish swim backward by wagging their heads! In her mind, in her world, it was a fact as true as any other. Fish swim backward by wagging their heads.</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Our lives are full of fish swimming backward. We make faulty leaps of logic. We make myriad assumptions. We prejudge. We harbor biases. We assume. We experience our beliefs and opinions as incontrovertible truths. We know that we are right and others are wrong. Fish swim by in reverse, frantically wagging their heads, and we do not notice them.</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;We are hardwired to do this. It is in our nature. As babies, we develop an understanding of our environment through countless observations of cause and effect. A baby drops her spoon on the ground. She is chastised by her mother, who bends to pick it up, washes it off in the sink, and then returns it to the breakfast tray. This scene plays out repeatedly for months or years, much to the mother&#x2019;s irritation. Along the way, the child learns about gravity, she begins to understand the concept that the floor is dirty, and she refines her understanding of how her actions can capture her mother&#x2019;s attention and impact her mother&#x2019;s emotions.</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This is how we learn to survive, to interact with our world. We are creatures designed to find order in chaos, definition in ambiguity, certainty in a world of probabilities. We build up a vast database of experiences and design for ourselves rules and logic consistent with those experiences. We generalize, simplify, predict.</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Our predisposition to reason from experience is a useful tendency, to put it mildly. It explains how our ancestors knew to run from a ferocious animal they had never before encountered, and how your child learns to say his first words. It also explains how a good salesman instinctually refines his pitch over time, learning to read responses and overcome common objections.</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This tendency is also the source of great harm. How often do you miscommunicate with someone because you are making faulty assumptions about his motives or meaning? On what basis have you decided that your goals, hopes, or dreams are unattainable? Do you fear the worst, &#x201c;borrowing trouble&#x201d;? Do you strive for unattainable perfection and find disappointment in the inevitable result? How often do you stop to consider the profound difference between what you know and what you think you know?</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Precocious little Dorothy&#x2019;s fish are amusing and innocent. Those that swim through our adult lives rarely are. In our careers and personal lives, in our relationships, and in our hearts and souls, our backward-?swimming fish do us great harm. They exact a toll in missed opportunities and unrealized potential. They paralyze us with fear. They engender insecurity and distrust where we seek fulfillment and connection. They breed bias and prejudice.</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In this book I will teach you to see the fish swimming backward through your life. I didn&#x2019;t notice mine until I slowly lost my sight to a progressive eye disease. But as I went blind I began to see them clearly. The deterioration of my sight cast them into focus. As I learned to recognize them, I embraced my blindness and gained a life richer in understanding, connection, and success. I call it living eyes wide open.</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;At work and at home, living eyes wide open has brought me immeasurable joy, fulfillment, and success. It is the philosophy that led me to leave behind my childhood acting career to attend college after starring as &#x201c;Weasel&#x201d; on NBC&#x2019;s sitcom Saved by the Bell: The New Class. I graduated from Harvard with an honors degree in mathematics and computer science at age nineteen, then founded an Internet advertising technology company. Living eyes wide open led me to leave that company when it was finally thriving, this time to attend Harvard Law School. After Harvard Law I spent three years litigating appeals in the federal courts as a U.S. Justice Department attorney before achieving my dream of serving as a U.S. Supreme Court Law Clerk, working for Justices Sandra Day O&#x2019;Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Then, in 2011 I saw eyes wide open the enormous potential in a struggling Orlando construction company. I put aside my legal career, figured out how to acquire the company, doubled down when the early days seemed to spell financial disaster, and turned it around, growing it tenfold in five years.</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Living eyes wide open is also how I accepted my blinding disease, then embraced it. With eyes wide open I cherish my extraordinary wife, Dorothy, and our marriage. I celebrate our six-year-old triplets, our ninety-eight-day fight for their health, and their miraculous triumph against all odds. I celebrate their little sister, too. I see my life bursting with blessings, and I strive for the grace to honor these blessings.</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;People often ask how I have had so many diverse experiences at such a young age or accomplished so much so quickly. Invariably, they will then say something like: &#x201c;And you did it all despite going blind. I can&#x2019;t imagine.&#x201d; Yet for me, going blind has not been a limitation on my life. In fact, it has helped me to achieve and to thrive. I&#x2019;ve derived great lessons and blessings by going blind. I&#x2019;ve gained vision by losing my sight.</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Going blind is the blessing that showed me how to live my life eyes wide open. But anyone can choose to see what I see, even the sighted! That&#x2019;s why I wrote this book. I wrote it to teach you how and to inspire you to do so. In the chapters that follow, I&#x2019;ll share practical ways to open yourself to new learning, unexplored opportunities, and your true potential. I&#x2019;ll help you to confront both your fears and your perceived limitations. I&#x2019;ll show you how to embrace your work and your life, not resign to them. And I&#x2019;ll challenge you to be a leader in your own life and in the lives of those around you.</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;But before you can live eyes wide open, you need to better understand what happens when you open your eyes. Paradoxically, when it comes to fish that swim backward, your sight obscures your vision. The way you experience sight makes it harder to spot these fish.</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Living with your eyes open and living eyes wide open are two very different things. In the difference lies the space those fish need to swim by undetected. They are hiding in plain view&#x2014;more precisely, they are hiding in your sight. Understanding how is the place to start.</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>Virtual Reality</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>Do you see with your eyes? I&#x2019;ll bet you find this question strange and the answer obvious. You&#x2019;re likely thinking, Of course I do. You&#x2019;re wrong. Here&#x2019;s another odd question: What happens when you open your eyes? When you open your eyes you see the world around you, right? There&#x2019;s not much more to say about it, is there? Now you&#x2019;re very wrong. (If you&#x2019;re thinking, This blind guy is crazy and I should stop reading his book, stay with me for another few pages, please!)</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;As a kid growing up in Miami, I would have given the same wrong answers to these two questions. I can picture myself at the age of thirteen acting on the set of a television commercial at Filmworks, attending one of my dad&#x2019;s many hearings in the Miami-Dade County Courthouse, or taking classes in the theater program at New World School of the Arts. I took my sight for granted, as most people do. It was not something I thought about. I saw just fine. I didn&#x2019;t even need glasses like the youngest of my older sisters, Ronit (pronounced &#x201c;row,&#x201d; as you would a canoe, and &#x201c;neat,&#x201d; as in &#x201c;interesting&#x201d;).</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;That thirteen-year-old Isaac would answer our two questions impatiently and confidently, saying something like: &#x201c;Yes, of course I see with my eyes. When I open my eyes I see what they are pointed at. I&#x2019;m walking away now, sorry.&#x201d; Young Isaac was invincible. He did not know he had a disease called retinitis pigmentosa, or RP, that would dramatically change his answers to these questions as he slowly went blind. But I did have RP, I did go blind, and my answers did change.</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;To understand how, imagine the &#x201c;Magic TV,&#x201d; the huge screen above center court at Orlando&#x2019;s Amway Center, where the Orlando Magic play. It&#x2019;s forty-two feet tall and forty-two feet wide, for a total area of 1,764 square feet. It has 9,470,400 pixels that collectively create the images you see, just like the pixels on your computer monitor.</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The retina at the back of each of your eyes is like that Magic TV. It is a little smaller, approximately one thousand square millimeters, and it has a bit more pixels, approximately 125 million on each retina. (Put another way, the average human retina has 13.2 times more &#x201c;pixels&#x201d; than Amway&#x2019;s screen, even though that giant screen is 163,881 times bigger.) In terms of resolution, the retina is 2,163,068 times more powerful.</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Instead of LED bulbs, the &#x201c;pixels&#x201d; of the retina are special cells called photoreceptor cells. They come in two varieties, known as &#x201c;rods&#x201d; and &#x201c;cones&#x201d; for their respective shapes. Just as the bulbs on the Jumbotron screen individually turn on or off to create an image in aggregate, each photoreceptor cell captures information about its tiny piece of the world. Each rod or cone cell is tuned to particular wavelengths, or colors, of light. (The more numerous rods respond to light of any color, while the cones, which are concentrated toward the center of the eye, each respond only to a particular color.) When a photoreceptor cell is hit by light that it is tuned to receive, it &#x201c;fires,&#x201d; producing a bit of biological magic, a chemical reaction that generates a signal sent back to your brain. When you open your eyes, your 250 million photoreceptor cells fire feverishly to create your image of the world.</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;RP causes the photoreceptor cells to deteriorate, cease to function and ultimately die. Returning to the Magic TV, imagine that you are watching my life as a movie on that giant screen. Imagine further that the pixels on that screen slowly and randomly break. At first, you might not even notice, but as more and more pixels break you will start to spot holes in the image, dark regions on the screen. Over time those regions will grow in size and number. As still more pixels break, you will eventually struggle to decipher what you are watching. That struggle will grow more difficult and less successful as more pixels break. You will see less and less of my life as the movie plays on, until finally you&#x2019;ll see nothing at all.</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;That is what my sight was like as RP progressively broke the photoreceptor cells of my retina. It is impossible to say exactly when the deterioration of my sight started, and it is impossible to pinpoint a precise moment in time when I became blind as a result. I know, however, that as a young child I grew up with seemingly normal sight, through my teens my sight was clearly failing, and by my early twenties my dwindling sight was of diminishing use to me. I lived as a blind man by my twenty-fifth birthday.</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;One pleasant Saturday in the spring of 1997, I was walking through Harvard Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on my way to buy a late lunch. I was seventeen years old, a sophomore studying mathematics and computer science at Harvard College. My late lunch was technically a very late breakfast, as I had managed to roust myself from my bed only an hour earlier. The plan for breakfast was a cheeseburger sub from Pinocchio&#x2019;s Pizza &amp; Subs on Winthrop Street&#x2014;or &#x201c;Nokes,&#x201d; as we called it. The plan was making my mouth water with eager anticipation.</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I turned a corner and a giant tree branch came flying at my head. Luckily, I reacted quickly, diving to the side, landing in some bushes. Major, perhaps life-threatening head trauma was narrowly avoided, and I sustained only a few minor scrapes and bruises. I stood up, brushed off dirt and leaves, and heartily congratulated myself for preventing major injury with my impressive catlike speed and reflexes.</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Then I looked around and realized the self-congratulation was unwarranted. There was no flying branch. There was a giant tree branch suspended over the sidewalk, well above my head, but it was firmly affixed to a towering tree. Neither the tree nor its branch had budged recently.</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;My lack of real physical injury notwithstanding, I felt substantial injury of the emotional kind. I was intensely embarrassed. I was frustrated by my failing eyes. I was angry that I was stuck with them.</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Worst of all, I was forced once again to contemplate the big questions, the ones that were never far from my mind in those days, the questions of my fears. How bad is this going to get? How quickly? What will my life become as I go blind? I didn&#x2019;t feel hungry anymore. I felt scared, sad, and lonely. I walked back to my dorm room in Lowell House and crawled back into my bed.</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In the months and years that followed, my retinas progressively deteriorated. My world blurred and morphed, the familiar and passive experience of sight becoming an arduous struggle to make sense of a bizarre carnival fun house hall of mirrors and illusions. This is when my answers to our two questions changed, how I learned: (1) You do not see with your eyes, you see with your brain. (2) The experience of sight is far more complex than perceiving what is around you. The flying tree branch I saw that day in Harvard Square came to symbolize these insights for me.</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Your eyes capture a breathtaking amount of information, but that&#x2019;s only where sight begins. A full third of your brain is devoted to processing that information. Known as the &#x201c;visual cortex,&#x201d; this third of your brain receives every second up to a billion signals from each of your retinas, two billion total. (The rest of your body can send your brain only an additional billion.) Your visual cortex creates from this torrent of two-dimensional data the three-dimensional experience we call sight, a truly miraculous feat. You see with your brain, not your eyes.</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Consider an unremarkable scenario. You see your friend Carol across a crowded room at a cocktail party and walk over to her. You navigate myriad obstacles along the way without effort or thought. For example, you dodge a waiter&#x2019;s tray of hors d&#x2019;oeuvres while mounting two small steps and hardly notice.</p></p><h2>Places in Time: A New Atlas of American History</h2><p>A tiny whaling village along the Pacific in 1490, New Plymouth as the Pilgrims settled in, Fort Mose as it welcomed African Americans escaping from slavery, Gettysburg on the day that decided the Civil War . . . Places in Time offers a bird&#x2019;s-eye view of twenty sites where American history was made.

She has written many history and geography books for children and teachers. She lives in New York City.<p>Gr 5-8-In the first book, a winning blend of facts, maps, and the drama of a well-written story results in an unusual and exciting view of this country's past. Some of the 20 individuals highlighted are well known, such as Daniel Boone, Ben Franklin, and Louis Armstrong. Others are more obscure, like Dame Shirley, a New England woman in the Gold Rush, and Venture Smith, an enslaved six-year-old African prince. Each double-page spread features an introduction, a story with numbered paragraphs relating to the map or illustration, a fact box, and colorful illustrations. All information is carefully researched and includes many primary resources. Any fictionalizing is marked with single quotation marks, while statements with actual historical evidence have double quotes. The second title uses the same format to present 20 sites in American history at the moment of their historical significance, beginning in 1200 (Cahokia) and ending in 1953. Places and times include New Plymouth-1627, Charlestown-1739, Saratoga-1777, Philadelphia-1787, Abilene-1871, and Chicago-1893. The detailed cutaway views of homes, forts, and mills are impressive enough to keep readers looking again and again. These fascinating slices of life stir the imagination and lead to questions and further research. Neither title has a bibliography, but scholars, historians, libraries, and museums are credited in the notes sections.

Goodrich, Webster's son-in-law and literary heir, who had been trained in lexicography by Webster himself, to be their editor in chief. Webster's son William also served as an editor of that first Merriam-Webster dictionary, which was published on September 24, 1847. </p> <p> Although Webster's work was honored, his big dictionaries had never sold well. The 1828 edition was priced at a whopping $20; in 13 years its 2,500 copies had not sold out. Similarly, the 1841 edition, only slightly more affordable at $15, moved slowly. Assuming that a lower price would increase sales, the Merriams introduced the 1847 edition at $6, and although Webster's heirs initially questioned this move, extraordinary sales that brought them $250,000 in royalties over the ensuing 25 years convinced them that the Merriams' decision had been abundantly sound. </p> <p> The first Merriam-Webster dictionary was greeted with wide acclaim. President James K. Polk, General Zachary Taylor (hero of the Mexican War and later president himself), 31 U.S. senators, and other prominent people hailed it unreservedly. In 1850 its acceptance as a resource for students began when Massachusetts ordered a copy for every school and New York placed a similar order for 10,000 copies to be used in schools throughout the state. Eventually school use would spread throughout the country. In becoming America's most trusted authority on the English language, Merriam-Webster dictionaries had taken on a role of public responsibility demanded of few other publishing companies.&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Reading for the Plot: Design and Intention in Narrative</h2><p>A book which should appeal to both literary theorists and to readers of the novel, this study invites the reader to consider how the plot reflects the patterns of human destiny and seeks to impose a new meaning on life.</p><p>Peter Brooks is Tripp Professor of Humanities at Yale University.&#x201c;Peter Brooks has delivered a major contribution to narrative theory and critical practice in a book remarkable for its lucidity and theoretical adventurousness.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Terry Eagleton</b><b>, </b><b><i>Literature and History</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;What is...gratifying about Brooks&#x2019;s approach is his insistence that plot elements must survive even the most radical postmodern consciousness...

Haas gives us a rare glimpse into the struggles for survival in the African wilderness. We accompany him in his jeep, camera primed and ready to react. With stories and photographs that portray actual events, we wait patiently to spot leopard cubs coming out of their cave to play; we are charged by protective adult elephants who surround a new-born; we move side-by-side with a clan of wild dogs as they hunt impalas.<br><br>All the stories in the book are intimate, engaging, and true. Haas shares his work with readers, teaching the key lessons that all wildlife photographers live by: patience, persistence, and an intense interest in animals. "When we are out there, we are working inside a world that is both fascinating and historic." This beautiful and inviting book draws readers into Haas&#x2019;s passion for Africa, for conservation, and for finding harmony between the actions of humans and the survival of wild animals.<br><br><i>African Critters</i> is a wonderful holiday gift for animal lovers of all ages, a valuable sourcebook for school reports, and an essential addition to any animal book collection.</p><p>Robert B. Haas has traveled extensively throughout Africa, photographing animals from the ground and from the air. His work has appeared in <i>National Geographic Magazine</i> and has been featured in his books <i>Through the Eyes of the Gods: An Aerial Vision of Africa</i> and <i>Through the Eyes of the Condor: An Aerial Vision of Latin America, </i> both published by National Geographic.Grade 3&#x2013;6&#x2014;Haas has culled from his experiences as a wildlife photographer for <i>National Geographic</i> and selected various vignettes about encounters with leopards, elephants, wild dogs, lions, hyenas, hippos, rhinos, and cheetahs. There are moments of drama and tension, awe and sadness in the first-person narratives. The author makes it clear that predators need to eat animals to survive, and he is obviously aware of his young audience. Although a buffalo herd kills a lion cub, the chapter ends with the information that its two siblings have survived and are safely rejoined with their mother. The writing is strong enough to stand on its own, but the photos steal the show. Close-ups allow youngsters to see the shadows in the eyes of a lion, a string of saliva in the mouth of a hyena, and a single purple dragonfly resting over the eye of a crocodile. Whether they are blurred to emphasize an animal's speed or sharp enough to count the whiskers on a mother cheetah, each photo or montage is a narrative on its own. On nearly every spread, a sidebar gives information about the species, and an insert at the beginning of the book describes the photographer's typical workday, hour by hour. Haas refers to the animals as "critters," generally considered a regional or slang term for "creatures," which may be jarring to some readers at first but will quickly be forgotten as the stories unfold. Each of the seven chapters would work as a read-aloud for an individual or group. Together they paint a fascinating picture of the work of a wildlife photographer.&#x2014;<i>Ellen Heath, Easton Area Public Library, Easton, PA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Yet most printed collections of folktales contain only stories, stripped of the human contexts in which they are told. If storytellers are mentioned at all, they are rarely consulted about what meanings they see in their tales. In this innovative book, Indian-American anthropologist Kirin Narayan reproduces twenty-one folktales narrated in a mountain dialect by a middle-aged Indian village woman, Urmila Devi Sood, or "Urmilaji." The tales are set within the larger story of Kirin Narayan's research in the Himalayan foothill region of Kangra, and of her growing friendship with Urmilaji Sood. In turn, Urmilaji Sood supplements her tales with interpretations of the wisdom that she discerns in their plots. At a moment when the mass-media is flooding through rural India, Urmilaji Sood asserts the value of her tales which have been told and retold across generations. As she says, "Television can't teach you these things."<br> These tales serve as both moral instruction and as beguiling entertainment. The first set of tales, focussing on women's domestic rituals, lays out guidelines for female devotion and virtue. Here are tales of a pious washerwoman who brings the dead to life, a female weevil observing fasts for a better rebirth, a barren woman who adopts a frog and lights ritual oil lamps, and a queen who remains with her husband through twelve arduous years of affliction. The women performing these rituals and listening to the accompanying stories are thought to bring good fortune to their marriages, and long life to their relatives. The second set of tales, associated with passing the time around the fire through long winter nights, are magical adventure tales. Urmilaji Sood tells of a matchmaker who marries a princess off to a lion, God splitting a boy claimed by two families into two selves, a prince's journey to the land of the demons, and a girl transformed into a bird by her stepmother.<br> In an increasingly interconnected world, anthropologists' authority to depict and theorize about distant people's lives is under fire. Kirin Narayan seeks solutions to this crisis in anthropology by locating the exchange of knowledge in a respectful, affectionate collaboration. Through the medium of oral narratives, Urmilaji Sood describes her own life and lives around her, and through the medium of ethnography Kirin Narayan shows how broader conclusions emerge from specific, spirited interactions. Set evocatively amid the changing seasons in a Himalayan foothill village, this pathbreaking book draws a moving portrait of an accomplished woman storyteller. <em>Mondays on the Dark Night of the Moon</em> offers a window into the joys and sorrows of women's changing lives in rural India, and reveals the significance of oral storytelling in nurturing human ties.<br></p><p>Oral tales establish relationships between storytellers and their listeners.

Now, eminent philosopher Simon Blackburn offers the most authoritative and up-to-date dictionary of philosophy available in a single volume, packed with helpful information for the novice and with astute observations for the expert. Ranging from Aristotle to Zen, the two thousand plus entries cover the entire span of philosophy, from the Vedas (written over three thousand years ago) to the most recent technical terminology, with ample coverage of important themes from Chinese, Indian, Islamic, and Jewish philosophy.<br> Here are all the terms one would expect to find in a comprehensive dictionary of philosophy--idealism and empiricism, ethics and aesthetics, Epicureanism and Stoicism, deism and pantheism, liberalism and conservatism, existentialism and logical positivism, and much more. Blackburn also defines many terms and concepts not normally found in such reference works, including entries for apathy, Elis (the Greek city which passed a law exempting all philosophers from taxation), laughter, and the meaning of life, and he includes relevant terms from disciplines such as mathematics, physics, biology, artificial intelligence, and linguistics. In addition, there are capsule biographies of nearly five hundred individuals, from the pre-Socratics, to such major figures as Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza, Locke, Hobbes, Hegel, Kant, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche, to such contemporary figures as Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Richard Rorty, Simone de Beauvoir, and Luce Irigaray. Many more women appear here than in other philosophical dictionaries, ranging from Lady Anne Finch Conway, a 17th-century Quaker philosopher and an influence on Leibniz, to Hypatia, an important 4th-century Neoplatonist and mathematician of Alexandria, who was tortured and murdered by Christian Monks at the behest of the patriarch Cyril. And Blackburn also includes figures such as Einstein, Darwin, and Aesop. Finally, Blackburn interjects much of his own personality and wit into these entries. For instance, writing on Francis Bacon, he observes that Bacon's "legal philosophy was one of absolute duty to the sovereign, which cannot have hindered his rise to the position of Lord Chancellor." And he begins his entry on apathy with "Although it is the particular enemy of teachers and sports coaches, apathy often gets a good philosophical press, especially in ethical systems that regard desire and worldly interest as low and unworthy."<br> A survey of philosophy through the eyes of one of its leading practitioners, <em>The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy</em> is both a handy reference and an intriguing book in which to browse. It is an essential volume for anyone interested in philosophy.</p><p><br><strong>Simon Blackburn</strong> is Edna J. Koury Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the University of North Carolina. He was a fellow and tutor at Pembroke College, Oxford University, from 1969 to 1990. He is the author of <em>Spreading the Word</em> and <em>Essays in Quasi-Realism</em>, and from 1984 to 1990, he was editor of the journal <em>Mind</em>.<br>Blackburn designed <i>The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy</i> "as a playground for browsers and a resource for anyone interested in general intellectual movements, as well as a simple work of reference." He was editor of the journal <i>Mind</i> from 1984 through 1990 and is currently a distinguished professor of philosophy at the University of North Carolina. He is author of <i>Essays in Quasi-Realism</i> (1993) and <i>Spreading the Word: Groundings in the Philosophy of Language</i> (1984). Blackburn operates in the Anglo-American analytic philosophical tradition, as opposed to the existentialist or phenomenological traditions of Europe.<p>The work is a distinctly personal one, though Blackburn's assessments of philosophical positions and discussions are objective and expository in tone. For example, of Immanuel Kant, he states, "his place as the greatest philosopher of the last 300 years is well assured.. . . [w]hilst his confidence in the a priori and the structure of his idealism have been widely rejected, it is not too much to say that all modern epistemology, metaphysics, and even ethics, is implicitly affected by the architecture he created."</p><p>The nearly 3,000 entries cover a wide variety of topics. Biographical entries include Aquinas, Russell, Isaiah Berlin, Michel Foucault, Darwin, and Keynes. While philosophers such as Plato and Nietzsche receive a page or more of treatment, those included for a peripheral contribution to philosophy, such as Keynes or Einstein, receive about half a column. Other entries run from a few lines to a page in length. Topics range back to the beginnings of Western and Eastern philosophy and across fields to discuss philosophical insights or approaches to economics, love, dreams, biology, and so forth. Yet the bulk of the dictionary consists of concise, focused definitions of terms used by analytic philosophers and philosophy students: <i>falsifiability</i>, <i>protocol statements</i>, <i>liar paradox</i>, <i>subjectivism/objectivism</i>, and <i>prisoners' dilemma</i>. Blackburn writes in an interesting and easy-to-follow style. He has made liberal use of cross-references (marked by asterisks within the text) and <i>see</i> and <i>see also</i> references at the end of entries. Some entries include bits of symbolic logic; a two-page appendix defines most of the symbols used.</p><p>This book is the most recent dictionary of philosophy. Dagobert Runes edited numerous editions of his <i>Dictionary of Philosophy</i> between 1942 and 1984 (Littlefield). Antony Flew's <i>Dictionary of Philosophy</i> came out in 1979 and 1984 (St. Martin's).

That&#x2019;s right, I&#x2019;m the guy who travels into the fantastic frame. I bet you remember me. I don&#x2019;t mean to sound like I&#x2019;m bragging. It&#x2019;s not like I think I&#x2019;m all that great or anything. I just know that it&#x2019;s hard to forget a person who gets sucked into a painting and only has an hour to get out.<br> &nbsp;<br> You don&#x2019;t meet someone like that every day.<br> &nbsp;<br> This little habit I have of time traveling into paintings began when my friend Luna Lopez and I discovered the fantastic frame. It hangs on the living room wall in the old run-down house, of our neighbor Viola Dots. At first, Luna and I thought it was nothing but a golden frame with carved animals and a clock on the front. We didn&#x2019;t know about the hour of power. That&#x2019;s when the clock on the frame strikes four and the painting inside opens up and sucks you in.<br> &nbsp;<br> But we sure found out about that hour of power in a hurry!<br> &nbsp;<br> If you ask me, I think Chives should have warned us. He&#x2019;s Viola&#x2019;s butler who happens to be an orange pig. But being a pig is no excuse, because he can talk.<br> &nbsp;<br> Chives knew that Viola&#x2019;s son, David, disappeared into the frame fifty years ago and never returned. The only thing she got back was pudgy Chives, who came flying straight out of some old pig painting wearing a top hat and a bowtie and has been living with her ever since.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs. Dots is a real grump, but Luna and I feel sorry for her, anyway. She misses her son, David, a lot, which is why we decided to help her. Every time Viola finishes a new painting for the frame, she asks us to go inside and look for David. She&#x2019;s never been able to go inside a painting herself. She always gets spit out. Maybe adults aren&#x2019;t allowed in. Or maybe it&#x2019;s just the grumpy adults who aren&#x2019;t allowed in.<br> &nbsp;<br> Once we&#x2019;re inside the painting, Luna and I have to watch the time carefully, because if we&#x2019;re not back at exactly the same spot in the painting at five o&#x2019;clock, then we could be stuck there forever.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now David, he really doesn&#x2019;t seem to mind being stuck inside paintings. I have to admit, sometimes it doesn&#x2019;t seem so bad to me, either. I wouldn&#x2019;t have to watch my annoying little sister, Maggie, chew with her mouth open. I wouldn&#x2019;t have to roll my socks into pairs and put them away in my sock drawer. And I wouldn&#x2019;t have to learn how to do subtraction word problems.<br> &nbsp;<br> On the other hand, I&#x2019;d miss my comfy bed and my dad&#x2019;s spaghetti sauce. Although those hot dogs and giant pretzels off the street cart in New York sure were delicious. But wait. I&#x2019;m getting ahead of myself. You don&#x2019;t even know about New York yet and the weird thing that happened there. I&#x2019;m talking weird with a capital <i>W</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> If you&#x2019;re interested, keep reading. You&#x2019;ll find out all about it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 1</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Luna and I stood on our driveway after school, staring at my new invention.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What do you think I should call it?&#x201d; I asked her.<br> &nbsp;<br> Luna&nbsp;walked around in a circle. She still had on the cool superhero cape she had worn to school that day. She looked at the contraption in front of her and scratched her head.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You could call it a <i>thingamajig</i>,&#x201d; she suggested. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s got a nice ring to it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But <i>thingamajig</i> doesn&#x2019;t tell you what it does,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Good point, Tiger. By the way, what<i> does</i> it do?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was Transportation Week at school. Everyone in our class had to do an oral report about a means of transportation.&nbsp;Luna chose to do hers on flying through the sky like Moon Girl. That&#x2019;s the superhero name she&#x2019;s given herself. She picked it because &#x201c;Luna&#x201d; means <i>moon</i> in Spanish. Too bad her parents didn&#x2019;t name her something cool like Shark or Crusher. Personally, I&#x2019;d take Shark Girl or the Crusher over Moon Girl any day.<br> &nbsp;<br> Even though Luna had gone to all the trouble of making herself a Moon Girl cape, our teacher, Ms. Warner, wasn&#x2019;t impressed. She said flying around on air currents was only a means of transportation for comic book characters. And everyone knows they don&#x2019;t actually exist.<br> &nbsp;<br> The report Ms. Warner loved was Andrew Hogan&#x2019;s on electric cars. She said it was outstanding, the best in the class. But then, she hadn&#x2019;t seen mine yet. Mine was going to knock her shoes <i>and</i> socks off. That&#x2019;s because I decided that instead of doing a report, I&#x2019;d invent my own means of transportation. And I did.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I got the idea for my invention yesterday,&#x201d; I explained to Luna, &#x201c;when I was riding my bike. I got really hungry and I thought&#x2014;wouldn&#x2019;t it be great to have a snack any time you want one? Even on a bike. So I invented this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. thingamajig!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Tiger, can I just point out one thing?&#x201d; Luna said. &#x201c;The thingamajig isn&#x2019;t a bike.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yeah, I noticed that,&#x201d; I answered. &#x201c;But I wasn&#x2019;t about to experiment with my brand-new bike. So I used my little sister&#x2019;s pink princess scooter instead.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Uh-oh. Something tells me Maggie&#x2019;s not going to like that.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;She won&#x2019;t care. She&#x2019;s totally over the princess thing.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Right. That&#x2019;s why she wore a diamond crown to preschool this morning. And carried a light-up wand.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t help it,&#x201d; I explained. &#x201c;I <i>had</i> to borrow her scooter. Don&#x2019;t tell, but I kind of borrowed my dad&#x2019;s cooler, too. See, I attached it to the scooter. The cooler gives you a nice place to sit while you&#x2019;re scooting and keeps your butt cool at the same time.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s important,&#x201d; Luna said. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want to get your butt all overheated.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> We both cracked up at that. It&#x2019;s nice to have a friend who makes you laugh.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s the great part about my invention,&#x201d; I went on. &#x201c;If you get hungry when you&#x2019;re scooting around, all you have to do is flip open the cooler and get yourself a snack. Snack and scoot, it&#x2019;s the perfect combo.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s it!&#x201d; Luna said. &#x201c;You just gave your invention a name. The Snack &#x2019;N&#x2019; Scoot.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hmmmmm&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Snack &#x2019;N&#x2019; Scoot.&#x201d; I rolled the words around in my mouth. They sounded pretty good.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s try it out,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We promised Viola we&#x2019;d be at her house before four o&#x2019;clock,&#x201d; Luna reminded me. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t be late for the hour of power.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We have a few minutes until then,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just take one quick spin.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I got on first and took off down the sidewalk. When I got to Viola&#x2019;s house, I slowed down and looked up the overgrown path to her crumbling blue house. It&#x2019;s so old and run-down, people on our block think it&#x2019;s haunted. Luna and I are the only people in the neighborhood who have ever been inside.<br> &nbsp;<br> I noticed Chives peeking out from behind the ragged red velvet curtain. He always keeps himself hidden. Viola doesn&#x2019;t want anyone to know that she has a talking orange pig for a butler. I waved to him. He took a gold watch out of his vest pocket and pointed to it with his hoof.<br> &nbsp;<br> I gave him a thumbs-up, to let him know we&#x2019;d be there on time, and rode back to Luna.<br> &nbsp;<br> As she was getting on the Snack &#x2019;N&#x2019; Scoot to take her turn, my dad&#x2019;s car pulled into the driveway. He was bringing my sister home from preschool. Maggie stuck her head out the car window.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hey, Tiger, that&#x2019;s <i>my</i> princess scooter,&#x201d; she yelled. &#x201c;Who said you could take it?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Told you,&#x201d; Luna whispered.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Listen, Maggie.&#x201d; I went to the car and lifted her out of her car seat. &#x201c;Did I ever tell you what a great little sister you are?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I plastered a giant smile on my face.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Put me down, Tiger. I want my scooter back.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s not a scooter anymore,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;Let me introduce you to the Snack &#x2019;N&#x2019; Scoot.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Maggie marched up to the scooter and looked it right in the handlebars.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m <i>not</i> happy to meet you,&#x201d; she said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, now, Tiger, it seems that you also took my cooler,&#x201d; my dad said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the one we take to the beach. I don&#x2019;t remember you asking permission to use it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sorry, Dad,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;but it&#x2019;s for my school project.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care what it&#x2019;s for,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t just take things without asking. I want you to return the cooler to the garage and the scooter to Maggie.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But, Dad!&#x201d; I cried. &#x201c;I have to do my transportation oral report tomorrow. And the Snack &#x2019;N&#x2019; Scoot is my report.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not anymore it isn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Luna, I&#x2019;m afraid Tiger can&#x2019;t play now. He&#x2019;s got to come inside and write his report. A real report this time.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He took Maggie&#x2019;s hand and they walked up the driveway to the house.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And you better not forget to put my purple basket back on,&#x201d; Maggie called over her shoulder. &#x201c;It has magical princess powers.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I was so mad, I wanted to scream.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My dad doesn&#x2019;t understand anything about my inventions,&#x201d; I told Luna. &#x201c;He wants me to do a plain old regular report. Now I&#x2019;ll have to write a whole bunch of paragraphs and look up words and stuff.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The worst part is that we&#x2019;re not going to be able to go to Viola&#x2019;s,&#x201d; Luna said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to miss the hour of power.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I was so angry, I had forgotten about the painting in the fantastic frame. It opened up at exactly four o&#x2019;clock, which was only a few minutes away. There was no way I could finish my report before then.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to disappoint Viola,&#x201d; I said to Luna. &#x201c;Maybe we should just go, anyway.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That would make your dad really mad,&#x201d; Luna said.<br> &nbsp;<br> I stood there trying to decide what to do, but only for a second. My thoughts were interrupted by Luna&#x2019;s mom, screaming out the top-floor window.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Luna! Luna!&#x201d; she called. &#x201c;Come quickly! You&#x2019;re not going to believe what&#x2019;s happened!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Joanne Fluke&#39;s Lake Eden Cookbook:: Hannah Swensen&#39;s Recipes from The Cookie Jar</h2><p><b>Joanne Fluke Invites You To Celebrate The Holidays With Hannah Swensen And All The Wonderful Folks Of Lake Eden, At The Annual Cookie Exchange. . .All-New Recipes Included!</b><br><br>It's a picture postcard December in Minnesota, and Main Street is brimming with festive holiday decorations.

It will take the light of all three to forge the Chalice anew and banish him again to his eternal darkness. With the Apocalypse looming, Erin must again join forces with Army Sergeant Jordan Stone and Father Rhun Korza to search for a treasure lost for millennia. But the prize has already fallen into the hands of their enemy, a demon named Legion, before whom even the walls of the Vatican will fall.<br><br> The search for the key to salvation will take Erin and the others across centuries and around the world, from the dusty shelves of the Vatican's secret archives to lost medieval laboratories, where ancient alchemies were employed to horrific ends. All the while, they are hunted, besieged by creatures of uncanny skill and talent. As clues are dug free from ancient underground chapels and found frozen in icy mountain caverns, Erin will discover that the only hope for victory lies in an impossible act--one that will destroy not only her, but all she loves. To protect the world, Erin must walk through the very gates of Hell and face the darkest of enemies: Lucifer himself.<br><br> With The Blood Gospel, the first novel in the Order of the Sanguines series, James Rollins and Rebecca Cantrell combined science, myth, and religion to introduce a breathtaking world where miracles hold new meaning and the fight for good over evil is far more complicated than we ever dreamed. And now, in this epic conclusion to the Sanguines trilogy, Blood Infernal, they take us to the very pit of Hell itself, making us peer into the abyss and face our greatest fears, to answer the ultimate question: What price will we pay for true salvation?</p><p><b>About James Rollins</b><br><br>JAMES ROLLINS is a #1 New York Times bestselling author of international thrillers that have been translated into more than forty languages.

His bestselling books, including <i>The Emerging Republican Majority</i> (1969) and <i>The Politics of Rich and Poor</i> (1990), have influenced presidential campaigns and changed the way America sees itself. Widely acknowledging Phillips as one of the nation's most perceptive thinkers, reviewers have called him a latter-day Nostradamus and our "modern Thomas Paine." Now, in the first major book of its kind since the 1930s, he turns his attention to the United States' history of great wealth and power, a sweeping cavalcade from the American Revolution to what he calls "the Second Gilded Age" at the turn of the twenty-first century.<br><br>The Second Gilded Age has been staggering enough in its concentration of wealth to dwarf the original Gilded Age a hundred years earlier. However, the tech crash and then the horrible events of September 11, 2001, pointed out that great riches are as vulnerable as they have ever been. In <i>Wealth and Democracy</i>, Kevin Phillips charts the ongoing American saga of great wealth&#x2013;how it has been accumulated, its shifting sources, and its ups and downs over more than two centuries. He explores how the rich and politically powerful have frequently worked together to create or perpetuate privilege, often at the expense of the national interest and usually at the expense of the middle and lower classes.<br><br>With intriguing chapters on history and bold analysis of present-day America, Phillips illuminates the dangerous politics that go with excessive concentration of wealth. Profiling wealthy Americans&#x2013;from Astor to Carnegie and Rockefeller to contemporary wealth holders&#x2013;Phillips provides fascinating details about the peculiarly American ways of becoming and staying a multimillionaire. He exposes the subtle corruption spawned by a money culture and financial power, evident in economic philosophy, tax favoritism, and selective bailouts in the name of free enterprise, economic stimulus, and national security.<br><br>Finally, <i>Wealth and Democracy</i> turns to the history of Britain and other leading world economic powers to examine the symptoms that signaled their declines&#x2013;speculative finance, mounting international debt, record wealth, income polarization, and disgruntled politics&#x2013;signs that we recognize in America at the start of the twenty-first century. In a time of national crisis, Phillips worries that the growing parallels suggest the tide may already be turning for us all.</p><p>Most American conservatives take it as an article of faith that the less governmental involvement in affairs of the market and pocketbook the better. The rich do not, whatever they might say--for much of their wealth comes from the "power and preferment of government." So writes Kevin Phillips, the accomplished historian and one-time Washington insider, in this extraordinary survey of plutocracy, excess, and reform. "Laissez-faire is a pretense," he argues; as the wealth of the rich has grown, so has its control over government, making politics a hostage of money. Examining cycles of economic growth and decline from the founding days of the republic to the recent collapse of technology stocks, Phillips dispels notions of trickle-down wealth creation, pricks holes in speculative bubbles, and decries the ever-increasing "financialization" of the economy--all of which, he argues, have served to reduce the well-being of ordinary Americans and government alike. Highly readable for all its charts and graphs, Phillips's book offers a refreshing--and, of course, controversial--blend of economic history and social criticism. His conclusions won't please all readers, but just about everyone who comes to his pages will feel hackles rising. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i><b>KEVIN PHILLIPS</b> has been a political and economic commentator for more than three decades.

But who is looking after the wounded hearts of the doctors?</p><p>After less than a year, young Barry Laverty, M.B., is settling in to the village, with only a few months to go before he becomes a full partner in the practice. He's looking forward to becoming a fixture in the community, until an unexpected romantic reversal gives him second thoughts. Will he truly be happy tending to routine coughs and colds for the rest of his career? After all, even when a more challenging case comes along, like a rare tropical disease, all he can do is pass it on to a qualified specialist or big-city hospital. As much as Barry enjoys the rough and tumble of life in County Down, is running a humble GP's shop all he wants out of life?</p><p>Barry's mentor, Doctor Fingal Flahertie O'Reilly, is going through some personal upheavals as well. After mourning his deceased wife for decades, he's finally allowed a new woman into his life. But this budding courtship is not going over well with Kinky Kincaid, the doctors' redoubtable housekeeper, who fears having her position usurped by O'Reilly's new flame. Tact, diplomacy, and a fair amount of blarney may be required to restore peace to the household.</p><p>Meanwhile, life goes on in Ballybucklebo, presenting both doctors with plenty of distractions from their own troubles. From a mysterious outbreak at the local school to a complicated swindle involving an unlucky racehorse, the two partners will need all of their combined wit and compassion to put things right again--just in time for their lives to change forever.</p></p><p><p><b>Patrick Taylor, M.D.</b>, is the author of the Irish Country books, including <i>An Irish Country Doctor</i>, <i>An Irish Country Village</i>, <i>An Irish Country Christmas</i>, and <i>An Irish Country Girl</i>.

He now lives on Saltspring Island, British Columbia.</p><p>1<br>A Crowd Is Not Company<br>Barry Laverty&#x2014;Doctor Barry Laverty&#x2014;stood in a jam-packed drawing room where the sound level was as intense as the racket of riveting guns in Harland and Wolff&#x2019;s shipyard. Over the noise of many conversations the gramophone blared.<br>How much is that doggie in the window?<br>Barry smiled and squeezed Patricia Spence&#x2019;s hand. Having her back home in Ulster was wonderful even if she had left it to the last minute to get here. He looked at her deep brown eyes, bent to her, and tried to make her hear. &#x201c;Somebody really likes Patti Page. She made that one a hit in 1953. I was thirteen.&#x201d;<br>Patricia shrugged.<br>So did Barry&#x2014;and he smiled. Bertie and Flo Bishop&#x2019;s 1964 version of their annual Boxing Day hooley was not a place for more than shouted small talk, and if Patricia hadn&#x2019;t heard Barry, so what? It wasn&#x2019;t as if she&#x2019;d been disinterested when he told her how much he loved her, how he wanted to start planning their future here in Ballybucklebo. Och, well, a couple more hours of this wouldn&#x2019;t matter, and then he would have her to himself and could tell her exactly what was on his mind. And damn it, this was a party.<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t suppose,&#x201d; he shouted into her ear, &#x201c;Bertie thinks much of the Beatles or the Dave Clark Five, but I thought he might have a recording of Roy Orbison&#x2019;s &#x2018;Pretty Woman.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br>She raised an eyebrow.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d ask him to play it for you.&#x201d; He squeezed her hand again. Her return was feeble.<br>Barry sighed. Was he boring her? He couldn&#x2019;t put his finger on it, but this morning she had seemed different from the laughing girl who&#x2019;d headed off three months ago to study civil engineering at Cambridge University. She was more distant. More detached. He shook his head. She&#x2019;d still be tired from travelling, that was all.<br>He looked around for space, somewhere he could talk to her, ask her if everything was all right, but it seemed the entire population of Ballybucklebo and the surrounding townland was in attendance. It was de rigueur to come to this party. No one refused an invitation from Bertie, and indeed Barry was pleased to have been asked after only six months as an assistant to Doctor Fingal Flahertie O&#x2019;Reilly. Being here was a mark of how well he was fitting into the little community in the north of County Down. Being accepted by the villagers was important. He&#x2019;d only six more months to go until he became a partner in the practice.<br>Patricia inclined her head toward the door. Her raven hair fell away from her neck in a rippling wave. By watching her lips he thought he could understand what she was saying. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see if it&#x2019;s quieter next door.&#x201d; She tugged his arm and began to force her way through the throng.<br>He followed Patricia into the hall, loosening the knot of his tie. He reckoned the anteroom to hell was probably kept at the same temperature. It was less noisy, but they were brought up short by a knot of people.<br>Barry recognized the carroty thatch of Donal Donnelly. He was fond of Donal, the first denizen of Ballybucklebo Barry had met last July while on his way to his interview with Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly. Julie Donnelly, n�e MacAteer, stood beside her husband, who had a tress of her hair firmly clasped between his right thumb and fore-finger. Not for the first time, Barry was struck by the beauty of her long, cornsilk locks.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m for having none of it. The brass neck of the man.&#x201d; Donal abruptly released Julie&#x2019;s hair, and the scowl on his usually cheerful face seemed odd at a party. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m for telling him to run away off and chase himself, so I am.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But Donal, it&#x2019;s only a few snaps.&#x201d; Julie sounded calm.<br>&#x201c;Huh. For everyone to gawp at? I&#x2019;m not having it, so I&#x2019;m not.&#x201d;<br>The couple had been married for three weeks, and if this was going to develop into a spat Barry would rather not become involved. But it was too late. Donal swung to him.<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll ask Doctor Laverty, so we will.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ask me what, Donal?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do you see thon man over thonder?&#x201d; He pointed back into the lounge to a tall, slim, immaculately coiffed individual of about thirty who wore a red velvet jacket and was smoking a cigarette held in an ivory cigarette holder.<br>Barry nodded. He was aware of Patricia standing at his shoulder.<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a cousin of Bertie Bishop, so he is. Big photographer, like. Has a studio up in Belfast.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Like Van Buren&#x2019;s?&#x201d; Barry asked, remembering the society photographer who took photos of couples at formal dances. They also did graduation portraits. His mother was very proud of one of Barry in his academic robe.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d not know about that, sir. I&#x2019;m not much of one for having my snaps took, but thon eejit wants Julie to pose for him.&#x201d; Donal bared his buckteeth. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not on, so it&#x2019;s not. Does he think she&#x2019;s the Venus de Millisle?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Milo, Donal. Venus de Milo. Millisle&#x2019;s a village on the Ards Peninsula down past Donaghadee.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Aye. Like enough you&#x2019;re right.&#x201d; He glowered at his wife. &#x201c;But she&#x2019;s not posing. Not for nobody.&#x201d;<br>Barry stole a glance at Donal&#x2019;s wife. He could understand why Bertie&#x2019;s cousin wanted her to model. She looked even more stunning than usual. Perhaps it was because&#x2014;as only she, Donal, Barry, and O&#x2019;Reilly knew&#x2014;she was pregnant again.<br>&#x201c;What kind of poses?&#x201d; Patricia asked.<br>&#x201c;Ask Julie,&#x201d; Donal snapped.<br>Julie smiled. &#x201c;Mr. Hunter introduced himself, admired my hair, and asked if I&#x2019;d think about letting him photograph me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Next thing she&#x2019;ll be in Spick and Span or Men Only, one of them smutty magazines,&#x201d; Donal said.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not like that, Donal,&#x201d; Julie said patiently. She turned to Patricia for support. &#x201c;Mr. Hunter says one of the big English shampoo companies is having a competition for their next shampoo girl. He thinks I could win it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You might well,&#x201d; Patricia said. &#x201c;Your hair is lovely.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve said no.&#x201d; Donal stood legs astraddle, arms folded over his chest. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m saying no more.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Donal,&#x201d; Patricia said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to hear a bit more about this.&#x201d; Donal sighed and inclined his head. &#x201c;Go on then,&#x201d; he said to Julie. &#x201c;You tell Miss Spence.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll pay me ten pounds each for two sessions. He&#x2019;s only interested in my hair. He&#x2019;d pay for hairdos too.&#x201d;<br>Donal put one hand against his chin. &#x201c;Ten pounds?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes. And if I get into the last five when they start the judging, the company guarantees fifty pounds, even if I only come in fifth. It goes up the better you place. If I come in first, they&#x2019;ll pay me five hundred pounds and I&#x2019;ll be on all their advertising and on their labels. I might even get to do a TV ad.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Five hundred pounds?&#x201d; Donal nodded to himself. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a powerful wheen of do-re-mi, so it is.&#x201d;<br>It&#x2019;s more than Donal would make in a year, Barry thought.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s all well and good,&#x201d; Donal said with a frown. &#x201c;But nobody does nothing for nothing. What&#x2019;s in it for him?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;If my photos win, he gets a prize too and a contract to take pictures for the company,&#x201d; Julie said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s only fair.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It is. You should both think about it,&#x201d; Patricia said, &#x201c;but it must be Julie&#x2019;s decision.&#x201d;<br>Donal shook his head. &#x201c;Not at all. She&#x2019;s my wife, so she is.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Julie who&#x2019;s going to be photographed,&#x201d; Patricia said firmly.<br>Donal looked from Patricia to Julie, back to Patricia, then turned to Barry. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m blowed if I know what to say, Doctor. What do you reckon?&#x201d;<br>The name&#x2019;s Laverty, not Solomon, Barry thought. And yet wasn&#x2019;t resolving dilemmas as much a part of rural medicine as treating coughs and colds, sniffles and sneezes? &#x201c;I think,&#x201d; Barry said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d be inclined to leave the choice up to Julie.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Would you, sir? Honest to God?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes. I would. Cross my heart.&#x201d;<br>Donal frowned. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll need to think on that for a wee while, sir.&#x201d; He brightened. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;d need a jar to help me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll see Patricia&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; Barry said.<br>&#x201c;Aye. Likely. Thank you, sir.&#x201d; He turned away, then back. &#x201c;Can I get you and Miss Spence one while I&#x2019;m at it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No thanks, Donal.&#x201d; Barry glowed. In Ulster the offer to get somebody a drink was a sure sign of fellowship.<br>Donal set off, pulling Julie by the hand. &#x201c; &#x2019;Scuse me, Cissie,&#x201d; he bawled at a heavy woman in a floral dress.<br>Barry guided Patricia past where Cissie Sloan stood talking, not to, but at, Alice Moloney, the dressmaker, as well as Mrs. Brown and Gertie Gorman.

Simone de Beauvoir saw a kaleidoscopic &#x201c;hall of mirrors,&#x201d; Aldous Huxley a &#x201c;city of dreadful joy.&#x201d; Where Jack Kerouac found a &#x201c;huge desert encampment,&#x201d; David Thompson imagined &#x201c;Marilyn Monroe, fifty miles long, lying on her side, half-buried on a ridge of crumbling rock.&#x201d;<br><br>In&nbsp;<i>Writing Los Angeles</i>, The Library of America presents a glittering panorama of the city, encompassing fiction, poetry, essays, journalism, and diaries by over seventy writers. This revelatory anthology brings to life the entrancing surfaces and unsettling contradictions of the City of Angels, from Raymond Chandler&#x2019;s evocation of the murderous moods fed by the Santa Ana winds to John Gregory Dunne&#x2019;s affectionate tribute to &#x201c;the deceptive perspectives of the pale subtropical light.&#x201d;<br><br>Here are fascinating strata of Los Angeles&#x2019;s cultural and social history, from the oil boom of the 1920s to the graffiti artists of the 1980s, from flamboyant evangelist Aimee Semple MacPherson to surf music genius Brian Wilson, from the German �migr� intellectuals chronicled by Salka Viertel to the hard-bitten homicide cops tracked by James Ellroy. Here are its fragile ecosystems, its architectural splendors, and its social chasms, in the words of writers as various as M.F.K.

Ulin is a regular contributor to the <b>Los Angeles Times</b> and <b>LA Weekly</b>. His work has also appeared in <b>GQ</b>, the <b>Nation</b>, <b>New York Times Book Review</b>, and <b>Atlantic Monthly</b>. Ulin is the editor of two acclaimed anthologies of writing about Los Angeles, where he lives.*Starred Review* Los Angeles is not a city easily categorized. It's a dream factory and a nightmare landscape, an urban creation teetering on the brink of natural disaster, eternally self-renewing and all but used up. The brilliance of this anthology is in the editor's determination to showcase as many facets of L.A. as possible, warts, beauty marks, and all. In nearly 900 pages, editor Ulin presents excerpts from novels and short stories, poems, diary entries, and newspaper and magazine articles. The time span ranges from Helen Hunt Jackson's influential 1884 novel about Los Angeles' mission era, <i>Ramona, </i>to works from the 1990s, including D. J. Waldie's social history, <i>Holy Land</i>, and William T. Vollman's examination of the 1992 L.A. riots, <i>The Atlas</i>, both published in 1996. In between are selections from such writers as H. L. Mencken, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Truman Capote, and Tom Wolfe. And, of course, there is the opening of Raymond Chandler's <i>Red Wind</i>, about a hot L.A. night spiked with a Santa Ana wind: "Meek little wives feel the edge of the carving knife and study their husbands' necks." Ulin's exemplary introduction delineates the history of L.A., reflects on what the city represents in popular culture, and analyzes the kind of writing L.A. has produced, with particular emphasis on <i>noir</i>, that most L.A. of forms. Each selection carries a brief, insightful introduction of its own. A stunning collection and a wonderful addition to the Library of America. <i>Connie Fletcher</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Grief, terror, love, longing--these were intangibles, but the intangibles had their own mass and specific gravity, they had tangible weight. They carried shameful memories. They carried the common secret of cowardice.... Men killed, and died, because they were embarrassed not to."</i><p> A finalist for both the 1990 Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award, <i>The Things They Carried</i> marks a subtle but definitive line of demarcation between Tim O'Brien's earlier works about Vietnam, the memoir <i>If I Die in a Combat Zone</i> and the fictional <i>Going After Cacciato</i>, and this sly, almost hallucinatory book that is neither memoir nor novel nor collection of short stories but rather an artful combination of all three. Vietnam is still O'Brien's theme, but in this book he seems less interested in the war itself than in the myriad different perspectives from which he depicts it. Whereas <i>Going After Cacciato</i> played with reality, <i>The Things They Carried</i> plays with truth. The narrator of most of these stories is "Tim"; yet O'Brien freely admits that many of the events he chronicles in this collection never really happened. He never killed a man as "Tim" does in "The Man I Killed," and unlike Tim in "Ambush," he has no daughter named Kathleen. But just because a thing never happened doesn't make it any less true. In "On the Rainy River," the character Tim O'Brien responds to his draft notice by driving north, to the Canadian border where he spends six days in a deserted lodge in the company of an old man named Elroy while he wrestles with the choice between dodging the draft or going to war. The real Tim O'Brien never drove north, never found himself in a fishing boat 20 yards off the Canadian shore with a decision to make. The real Tim O'Brien quietly boarded the bus to Sioux Falls and was inducted into the United States Army. But the truth of "On the Rainy River" lies not in facts but in the genuineness of the experience it depicts: both Tims went to a war they didn't believe in; both considered themselves cowards for doing so. Every story in <i>The Things They Carried</i> speaks another truth that Tim O'Brien learned in Vietnam; it is this blurred line between truth and reality, fact and fiction, that makes his book unforgettable. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Houghton Mifflin hardcover 1990/Previous ISBN 978-0-395-51598-3</p><h2>Dying to Please: A Novel</h2><p>Loyal.

And, as Gail Dines shows, today&#x2019;s porn is strikingly different from yesterday&#x2019;s <i>Playboy</i>. As porn culture has become absorbed into pop culture, a new wave of entrepreneurs are creating porn that is even more hard-core, violent, sexist, and racist. Proving that porn desensitizes and actually limits our sexual freedom, Dines argues its omnipresence is a public health concern we can no longer ignore.</p><p><b>Gail Dines&nbsp;</b>is professor of sociology and women&#x2019;s studies at Wheelock College. The author of two previous books and a regular commentator on TV and radio, Dines has been covered in <i>Newsweek, Time, USA Today, </i>the <i>New York Times, Boston Globe, </i>and <i>Philadelphia Inquirer. </i>She lives in Brookline, Massachusetts<b>.</b><b>From Chapter Six, "Growing Up Female in a Porn Culture"</b><br><br>In her excellent book on body image and food, feminist philosopher Susan Bordo looks at the ways the culture helps shape women&#x2019;s ideas about what constitutes the perfect body. The bodies of the women we see in magazines and on television are actually very unusual in their measurements and proportions, with long necks, broad shoulders, and high waists. Yet because these are more or less the only images we see, we take them to be the norm rather than the exception and as�sume that the problem lies with us and not the fashion and media indus�tries that insist on using a very specific body type. This is what the media do: they take the abnormal body and make it normal by virtue of its vis�ibility, while making the normal bodies of real women look abnormal by virtue of their invisibility. The result is a massive image disorder on the part of society. Since we all develop notions of ourselves from cultural messages and images, it would seem that a truly disordered female is one who actually likes her body. <br><br>Bordo&#x2019;s discussion of the way culture shapes notions of the body asks us to rethink the idea that women with eating disorders are somehow deviants. Women who starve themselves are actually overconforming to the societal message about what constitutes female perfection. They have taken in the messages and come to what looks like a very reasonable conclusion: thin women are prized in this culture, I want to be prized, and therefore I need to be thin, which means that I can&#x2019;t eat. How can it be any different in a world where anorexic-looking women such as Kate Moss, Victoria Beckham, Mary Kate Olsen, and Lindsay Lohan are praised by the celebrity magazines for their &#x201c;look&#x201d;? I do not mean to be glib here about the devastating effects of starving one&#x2019;s body. I have seen many students with a long list of health problems due to long-term starvation. But somewhere in this discussion, we need to see the society as pathological rather than the adolescent girl in the hospital ward who is being diagnosed with multiple disorders. <br><br>Many of the young women I have spoken to who have been hos�pitalized for eating disorders talk about all the new tricks they learned from fellow patients for losing weight even faster. Not many talk about their hospitalizations in terms of recovery. While many of these young women end up hospitalized for complex reasons, the cultural obsession with female thinness has to figure in somewhere for most of them. Yet these recovery programs do not have classes on media literacy and cul�tural constructions of gender or rap sessions on resisting sexist imagery. Instead the focus is squarely on the individual female and her assumed psychological problems, which somehow dropped from the sky. One story that demonstrates the cultural components of this so-called indi�vidual disorder is writer Abra Chernik&#x2019;s experience of having a day out from the hospital, where she is being treated for anorexia.13 Close to death, Chernik goes to the mall and takes a &#x201c;fat test&#x201d; at a sporting goods store. She learns she is this week&#x2019;s winner, with the lowest percentage of body fat, and everyone in the store breaks into applause. Chernik then returns to the hospital, where she is meant to recover with intense therapy that explores her personal problems. Meanwhile, the culture is left intact. <br><br>Understanding culture as a socializing agent requires exploring how and why some girls and young women conform and others resist. For all the visual onslaught, not every young woman looks or acts like she take her cues from <i>Cosmopolitan </i>or <i>Maxim. </i>One reason for this is that conforming to a dominant image is not an all-or-nothing act but rather a series of acts that place women and girls at different points on the continuum of conformity to nonconformity. Where any individual sits at any given time on this continuum depends on her past and present experiences as well as family relationships, media consumption, peer group affiliations and sexual, racial, and class identity. We are not, after all, blank slates onto which images are projected. <br>Given the complex ways that we form our sexual and gender iden�tities, it is almost impossible to predict, with precision, how any one individual will act at any one time. This does not mean, though, that we can&#x2019;t make predictions on a macro level. What we can say is that the more one way of being female is elevated above and beyond others, the more a substantial proportion of the population will gravitate toward that which is most socially accepted, condoned, and rewarded. The more the hypersexualized image crowds out other images of women and girls, the fewer options females have of resisting what cul�tural critic Neil Postman called &#x201c;the seduction of the eloquence of the image.&#x201d;<br><br>Conforming to the image is seductive as it not only offers women an identity that is in keeping with the majority but also confers a whole host of pleasures, since looking hot does garner the kind of male at�tention that can sometimes feel empowering. Indeed, getting people to consent to any system, even if it&#x2019;s inherently oppressive, is made easier if conformity brings with it psychological, social, and/or material gains. Many women know what it&#x2019;s like to be sexually wanted by a man: the way he holds you in his gaze, the way he finds everything you say worthy of attention, the way you suddenly become the most compelling person in the world. This is the kind of attention we don&#x2019;t normally get from men when we are giving a presentation, having a political conversation, or telling them to do the dishes. No, this is an attention men shower on women they want sexually, and it feels like real power, but it is ephem�eral because it is being given to women by men who increasingly, thanks to the porn culture, see women as interchangeable hookup partners. To feel that sense of power, women need to keep sexing themselves up so they can become visible to the next man who is going to, for a short time, hold her in his lustful gaze. <br><br>Those girls and young women who resist the wages of sexual objec�tification have to form an identity that is in opposition to mainstream culture. What I find is that these young women and girls tend to have someone in their life&#x2014;be it a mother, an older woman mentor, or a coach&#x2014;who provides some form of immunization to the cultural mes�sages. But often this immunization is short-lived. Every summer I co�teach an institute in media literacy, and many of the participants are parents or teachers. Year after year we hear the same story: they are working hard to provide their daughters or students with ways to resist the culture, and in their early years the girls seem to be internalizing the counter-ideology. However, at some point, usually around puberty but increasingly earlier, the girls begin to adopt more conventional fem�inine behavior as their peer group becomes the most salient socializ�ing force. This makes sense because adolescence is the developmental stage that is all about fitting in. Indeed, in a strange way, one becomes visible in adolescence by looking like everyone else, and to look and act differently is to be rendered invisible. <br><br>What many of these young women and girls need to be able to continue resisting the dominant culture is clearly a peer group of like-minded people as well as an ideology that reveals the fabricated, exploit�ative, and consumerist nature of contemporary femininity. Alternative ideologies such as feminism that critique dominant conceptions of femi�ninity are either caricatured or ignored in mainstream media. Absent such a worldview and a community of like-minded people, many young women speak about feeling isolated and alone in their refusal to con�form to the porn culture. The stories are the same: they have a lot of difficulty in negotiating the outsider status that they have been forced to take on. They not only refuse to sex themselves up, they also re�fuse to have hookup sex, which means that they have a difficult time finding men who are interested in them.</p><h2>Picking Up: On the Streets and Behind the Trucks with the Sanitation Workers of New York City</h2><p><p><b>"Meticulous . . . [Nagle's] passion for the subject really comes to life." </b><b>&#x2015;</b><i><b>The New York Times</b></i><br><b><i></i></b><br><b><i></i></b>New York City produces more than twelve thousand tons of household trash and recyclables a day. As quickly as it accumulates, it's hauled away. But who makes that happen? What's life like for the workers with careers built around garbage? <br> In <i>Picking Up</i>, the anthropologist Robin Nagle takes us inside New York City's Department of Sanitation, a largely unseen and often unloved army responsible for keeping the city alive. Nagle spent a decade with sanitation people of all ranks to learn what it takes to manage Gotham's garbage. She even took the job herself, driving trucks and plowing snow while enduring the physical aches, public abuse, and risk of injury that are constant realities of the job. Nagle offers an insider's perspective on the complex hierarchies, intricate rules, and obscure language unique to this mostly invisible world.<br> Not just a contemporary account, <i>Picking Up</i> charts New York City's four-hundred-year struggle with trash. It traces the city's waste-management efforts from a time when filth overwhelmed the streets to today's far more vigorous practices, which have made the city cleaner than it's been in decades. <br> Complete with vividly evoked characters and memorable descriptions of the sights and smells of the job, <i>Picking Up</i> reveals the vital role sanitation workers play in every city across the globe.</p></p><p><p>Robin Nagle has been anthropologist-in-residence at New York City's Department of Sanitation since 2006. She is a clinical associate professor of anthropology and urban studies at New York University, where she also directs the Draper Interdisciplinary Master's Program in Humanities and Social Thought.</p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Garbage Faeries <br>&nbsp; <br> <br>It was a radiant autumn morning. Tree leaves and car windows sparkled. The garbage bags that filled the back of our collection truck shimmered as Ray Kurtz pulled the handles that activated the bawling hydraulics of the hopper blade. Eager to be useful, I leaned against the load so no errant pieces would fall out, then stepped aside while the blade moved down and pushed the pile into the truck&#x2019;s body. The machinery howled a note higher as it finished its cycle. <br>Kurtz was a loose-limbed blond who looked younger than his forty-eight years. He had a mullet, an easy smile, a gently self-deprecating sense of humor, and about eighteen years as a New York City sanitation worker&#x2014;or &#x201c;garbageman,&#x201d; in common parlance. His partner, who threw bags toward us from farther up the curb, was Sal Federici, a dark-haired fifty-something with more than twenty years on the job. Federici, tall and lean, was enigmatically quiet and a liberal smoker. Kurtz had been a few-packs-a-day man himself until the emphysema diagnosis.* <br>I was working behind a garbage truck so that I might better understand some of the human costs and labor requirements of waste. All of us create trash in great quantities, but it&#x2019;s a troubling category of stuff that we mostly ignore. We particularly ignore how much care and attention it requires from a large, well-organized workforce. What would life be like if the people responsible for managing the waste of contemporary society were not on the streets every day? What do their jobs entail? Why don&#x2019;t they get the kudos they deserve? These are urgent questions, and since I live in New York, I decided to look for answers among the men and women of the city&#x2019;s Department of Sanitation. The best way to learn about their work was to do it with them, a notion that eventually inspired me to get hired as a san worker, but I started my research by accompanying Sanitation crews in various parts of the city&#x2014;which is how I found myself behind the truck on that beautiful morning, marveling at the light and trying not to get in Kurtz&#x2019;s way. <br>Both Kurtz and Federici had spent their careers in a Sanitation district called Manhattan 7, and both had enough seniority to be regulars in section 1, the district&#x2019;s plum assignment. The 1 has a reputation for clean garbage. The bags don&#x2019;t often break and maggots are less common, even in summer&#x2019;s heat. <br>Every crew starts their shift with a long oaktag card, formally called the Daily Performance Record but more commonly known as the 350, on which their supervisor has written that day&#x2019;s route (pronounced like &#x201c;grout,&#x201d; not &#x201c;root&#x201d;).1 A route is figured in lines called ITSAs&#x2014;Individual Truck Shift Assignments&#x2014;that indicate the specific block and side of the street to be collected, and in what order. The south side of Eighty-Fourth Street from Broadway to Central Park West, a distance of three blocks, is three lines. This particular example would be written &#x201c;84, B&#x2019;Way&#x2013;CPW, s/s.&#x201d; If both sides were to be collected (abbreviated on a 350, logically enough, as b/s), it would constitute six lines.2 Kurtz was explaining some of these details while we worked. Federici just smiled, taking drags on his cigarette between bag flings. <br>Kurtz was the driver and Federici the loader, but both men tossed bags. That particular day, on a block of fastidiously restored brownstones near Central Park West, we were doing house-to-house.* We picked up the garbage left in front of one small building&#x2014;a town house or a modest apartment complex or a church, for example&#x2014;and then moved the truck forward a stoop or two to get the pile that waited in front of the next small building, and the next, and the next. The quiet morning streets had been our domain when we started at 6:00, but by about 7:30 more and more people with pressed clothes and closed faces were emerging from doorways and descending stoops. It felt odd that our day was already well under way while these sluggards were only now heading to work, but my colleagues didn&#x2019;t pay them much attention. The passersby paid us even less. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>The workforce of Sanitation is surprisingly small. New York&#x2019;s 8.2 million residents are served by fewer than 10,000 Sanitation employees (9,216, to be precise: 7,383 uniformed personnel and 1,833 civilians), all of whom make it possible for the DSNY to carry out its three-part mandate.3 The first two parts involve picking up the garbage and figuring out where to put it. Sanitation makes sure that more than six thousand miles of streets are swept several times a week and that the city&#x2019;s eleven thousand tons of household trash and two thousand tons of household recycling are collected every day.4 Both these tasks are organized by the Department&#x2019;s Bureau of Cleaning and Collection. Most of the people who work in uniformed titles are assigned to BCC. Once the trash is off the streets, the Bureau of Waste Disposal has to put it somewhere. The problem occupies many fewer people than are required for cleaning and collection, but BWD accounts for a quarter of Sanitation&#x2019;s $1.35 billion budget.5 <br>Snow removal is the Department&#x2019;s third duty. Snow does not belong to any single bureau. The public might assume it&#x2019;s a concern only during the cold months, but everyone on the job, in every title and in every office and among all ranks, will tell you that the many tasks required in preparing for winter make snow a year-round focus. <br>Behind these organizational divisions stands an eclectic assortment of support personnel. Mechanics, lawyers, plumbers, architects, engineers, electricians, analysts, carpenters, and a host of others keep the physical and political machinery of the Department moving smoothly. <br>The Manhattan 7 garage serves the Upper West Side neighborhood, which is where I was working with Kurtz and Federici. It&#x2019;s one of the fifty-nine districts into which the Department divides itself across the city. Districts, or garages&#x2014;the words are interchangeable&#x2014;are managed through seven borough-based commands. (There are five boroughs in New York, but Sanitation splits Queens administratively into West and East, Brooklyn into North and South.) Manhattan has twelve districts, as does the Bronx; Brooklyn North and Brooklyn South have nine districts each; Queens East and Queens West have seven each, and Staten Island has three. <br>Every district is commanded by a superintendent who oversees a team of supervisors, also known informally by their older title of foremen. Supervisors directly manage the sanitation workers who drive the trucks, pick up the trash, and operate the mechanical brooms. Supervisors also serve as intermediaries between what happens on the street and what happens higher up the Department bureaucracy. Until 2011, their responsibilities were organized according to sections, the smaller units into which districts are divided. <br>Geography, staffing needs, and equipment allocations vary from one garage to the next. Manhattan 1, for example, is a small district of just three sections. M1 covers the Wall Street area, runs about 20 collection trucks and 15 recycling trucks a week, and hosts 55 workers, officers, and support staff across all shifts. A big district like Brooklyn South 18, by contrast, has seven sections, runs 150 collection and 66 recycling trucks every week, and has 168 workers. Queens East 13, so big that it&#x2019;s called the Ponderosa, covers eight sections out of two garage facilities. Each week, about 185 collection trucks, 72 recycling trucks, and 200 workers serve the neighborhoods of Laurelton, Rosedale, Bellerose, and Queens Village.6 <br>If truck allocations are the measure, Manhattan 7, which has five sections and runs about a hundred collection and fifty recycling trucks a week, is the borough&#x2019;s second busiest.7 Four of M7&#x2019;s five sections boast trendy shops, lace-curtain restaurants, and a surfeit of luxury residential real estate, which varies from well-kept single-family homes and block-square prewar palaces to big-box newcomers like Donald Trump&#x2019;s mammoth structures on a former rail yard overlooking the Hudson River. In the 5 section, the district&#x2019;s northernmost, Spanish is heard as often as English, and corner bodegas are more common than high-end retailers. It&#x2019;s easier to find small diners not famous for their coffee than cloth-napkin establishments requiring reservations. Columbia University, edging the top of the 5, inflects the streets with a college-town accent. Garbage in the 5 is supposedly heavier and messier than in the rest of the district and is alleged to attract more rats. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Kurtz, Federici, and I were making our way down a street lined with tall sycamore trees and elegant town houses when all at once, as if she had materialized out of the remarkable morning light, a muse appeared. She was tall, slender, in her mid-twenties, with flawless olive skin, large eyes, full lips. Her hair, neat behind her shoulders, bounced lightly in sync with her brisk footsteps. Surely, I thought, this was the inspiration for Richard Wilbur&#x2019;s poem &#x201c;Transit,&#x201d; which starts, &#x201c;A woman I have never seen before / Steps from the darkness of her town-house door / At just that crux of time when she is made / So beautiful that she or time must fade.&#x201d; <br>As we turned to watch her, time did fade. So did our focus on our work. <br>&#x201c;What use to claim that as she tugs her gloves / A phantom heraldry of all the loves / Blares from the lintel? That the staggered sun / Forgets, in his confusion, how to run?&#x201d;8 <br>Never mind the sun&#x2014;Kurtz was the one who was staggered. He leaned against the truck, folded his arms, and gazed at her; when a trace of her perfume reached us, he closed his eyes and inhaled deeply. I imagined tendrils of fragrance curling cartoon-style around his chin, tickling his nose with a long feminine finger. He smiled hugely, his eyes still closed, and I smiled as well to see a man so frankly enjoy the sight, and scent, of a woman. <br>I didn&#x2019;t know it yet, but that morning on the street I was also observing a man who could stare so blatantly because any potentially disapproving members of the public wouldn&#x2019;t notice him doing it. In fact, as Kurtz knew well, passersby didn&#x2019;t even see him. Years on the job had taught him that when he put on his uniform every morning, like Federici and every other sanitation worker in the city, he became invisible. <br>In mechanical brooms or driving the truck, san workers are merely obstacles to be skirted. When I worked parade cleanups in warm weather, I quickly learned that it was useless to ask bystanders who lingered against the barricades to move back just a little. The coarse bristles of my hand broom were going to scrape their sandaled feet, but even when I stood directly in front of them saying &#x201c;Excuse me&#x201d; over and over, they didn&#x2019;t see or hear me. It&#x2019;s not that they were ignoring me: I was never part of their awareness in the first place. <br>Uniforms in general change the way any worker is perceived. The man or woman wearing a uniform becomes the Police Officer or the Firefighter, the Soldier, the Doctor, the Chef. Individuality is subsumed by the role that the clothing implies.9 But the sanitation worker is more than just subsumed by a role. Because of the mundane, constant, and largely successful nature of his work, his uniform (its official color is spruce) acts as a cloaking device. It erases him. He doesn&#x2019;t carry guns or axes, no one begs for him in a 911 call, he is not expected to step into a crisis, to soothe an emergency, to rescue innocents.10 Instead, his truck and his muscle punctuate the rhythms of a neighborhood at such regular intervals that he becomes a kind of informal timepiece. <br>Effective garbage collection and street cleaning are primary necessities if urban dwellers are to be safe from the pernicious effects of their own detritus. When garbage lingers too long on the streets, vermin thrive, disease spreads, and city life becomes dangerous in ways not common in the developed world for more than a century. It is thus an especially puzzling irony that the first line of defense in any city&#x2019;s ability to ensure the basic health and well-being of its citizenry is so persistently unseen, but the problem is hardly unique to New York. <br>John Coleman, president of Haverford College in the early 1970s, spent part of a sabbatical working for two weeks as a &#x201c;garbageman&#x201d; near Washington, D.C. His route took him to a tony suburban neighborhood late on a Saturday morning.11 &#x201c;I thought this might mean more talk back and forth as I made the rounds today,&#x201d; he mused. &#x201c;While I wouldn&#x2019;t have time to talk at length, there was time to exchange the greetings that go with civilized ways. This was where I got my shock.&#x201d; <br>Both men and women gave me the silent or staring treatment. A woman in housecoat and curlers putting her last tidbit of slops into the pail was startled as I came around the corner of her house. At the sound of my greeting, she gathered her housecoat tightly about her and moved quickly indoors. I heard the lock click&nbsp;&#x2026; Another woman had a strange, large animal, more like a vicu�a than anything else, in her yard. I asked her what kind of dog it was. She gaped at me. I thought she was hard of hearing and asked my question louder. There was a touch of a shudder before she turned coldly away. A man playing ball with his two young sons looked over in response to my voice, stared without a change of face, and then calmly threw the next ball to one of the boys. And so it went in almost every yard.12 <br>No wonder people gaped at him or turned away. By speaking to the householders he met on his route, Coleman had transgressed. Invisible laborers are not supposed to make themselves noticed. They are meant to do their work and move along, heads down and mouths shut. Though most householders would admit, if pressed, that the people who tote away their garbage are important in the larger scheme of things, it doesn&#x2019;t mean they must acknowledge the one who does the toting. Heaven forfend! <br>Here&#x2019;s an especially illuminating and depressingly common example of Invisibility Syndrome, one I&#x2019;ve heard from junior Sanitation folk and seasoned vets alike. A san man reaching to pick up a bag of trash encounters a dog walker who lets Fido let loose at that exact instant on that exact bag. Imagine the san man in motion, his body bent so he can grasp the slick plastic of the bag, finding himself face-to-face with a dog&#x2019;s raised leg and liquid output. A variation on this theme is that the dog walker plops a sample of the pooch&#x2019;s poop precisely where the worker is reaching, in which case the worker in motion closes his fist not around the ear of the bag but around a bagged (or sometimes unbagged) pile of shit. <br>The situation presents a few choices. The worker can ignore it. Or he can politely but firmly point out to the dog walker that her behavior is offensive. Or he can become irate. A new hire still on probation is wise to stay quiet, though he in particular will often find that the most difficult choice. A san worker with a few years on the job who is familiar with this moment knows that nothing he does or says will change the dog walker&#x2019;s attitude or behavior&#x2014;in fact, even a polite comment from him will most likely inspire invective&#x2014;so he usually doesn&#x2019;t bother to respond. <br>But to another man with a few years on the job, or perhaps the same man on a different day, the rudeness can carry an unexpected prickle, maybe even a sting, that ruptures his calm. In the versions I&#x2019;ve heard, the san man who decides to protest always starts by speaking respectfully, which may or may not be true, and the dog walker always responds with obscenities, which I believe. The curses are variations on the command that the san man mind his...</p><h2>Conscious Femininity (STUDIES IN JUNGIAN PSYCHOLOGY BY JUNGIAN ANALYSTS)</h2><p>1993 INNER CITY BOOKS SOFTCOVER</p><p></p><h2>The Hand of Chaos (Death Gate Cycle, Book 5)</h2><p>Chaos is everywhere as the Lord of the Nexus orders his servant Haplo and the human child known as Bane to further their master&#39;s work on Arianus, the realm of air.

The water rose slowly, flowed through doors and windows, eased over low rooftops. Fragments of Sartan life floated on the water&#x2019;s surface&#x2014;an unbroken pottery bowl, a man&#x2019;s sandal, a woman&#x2019;s comb, a wooden chair.<br> &nbsp;<br> The water seeped into the room of Samah&#x2019;s house used by the Sartan as a prison cell. The prison room was located on an upper floor and was, for a time, above the rising tide. But, eventually, the seawater slid under the door, flowed across the floor, crept up the room&#x2019;s walls. Its touch banished magic, canceled it, nullified it. The dazzling runes, whose flesh-searing heat kept Haplo from even approaching the door, sizzled and went out. The runes that guarded the window were the only ones yet left unaffected. Their bright glow was reflected in the water below.<br> &nbsp;<br> Prisoner of the magic, Haplo sat in enforced idleness watching the runes&#x2019; reflections in the rising seawater, watched them move and shift and dance with the water&#x2019;s currents and eddies. The moment the water touched the base of the runes on the window, the moment their glow began to glimmer and fade, Haplo stood up. The water came to his knees.<br> &nbsp;<br> The dog whined. Head and shoulders above the water, the animal was unhappy.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This is it, boy. Time to leave.&#x201d; Haplo thrust the book in which he&#x2019;d been writing inside his shirt, secured it at his waist, tucked it between pants and skin.<br> &nbsp;<br> He noticed, as he did so, that the runes tattooed on his body had almost completely faded. The seawater that was his blessing, that was allowing him to escape, was also his curse. His magical power gone, he was helpless as a newborn child, and had no mother&#x2019;s comforting, protecting arms to cradle him.<br> &nbsp;<br> Weak and powerless, unsettled in mind and in soul, he must leave this room and plunge into the vast sea whose water gave him life as it washed away his life, and it would carry him on a perilous journey.<br> &nbsp;<br> Haplo thrust open the window, paused. The dog looked questioningly at its master. It was tempting to stay here, to stay safe in his prison. Outside, somewhere beyond these sheltering walls, the serpents waited. They would destroy him, they must destroy him; he knew the truth. Knew them for what they were&#x2014;the embodiment of chaos.<br> &nbsp;<br> This knowledge of the truth was the very reason he had to leave. He had to warn his lord. An enemy greater than any they&#x2019;d yet faced&#x2014;more cruel and cunning than any dragon in the Labyrinth, more powerful than the Sartan&#x2014;was poised to destroy them.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Go on,&#x201d; Haplo said to the dog, and gestured.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cheered at the prospect of finally leaving this soggy, boring place, the dog leapt gleefully out the window, splashed into the water in the street below. Haplo drew in a deep breath&#x2014;an instinctive reaction, not really necessary, for the seawater was breathable as air&#x2014;and jumped in after.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Chalice was the only stable land mass in the water world of Chelestra. Built by the Sartan to more closely resemble the world they had sundered and fled, the Chalice was encased in its own protective bubble of air. The water that surrounded it gave the illusion of sky, through which Chelestra&#x2019;s water-bound sun shone with a rippling brightness. The serpents had broken through the barrier and now the Chalice was flooding.<br> &nbsp;<br> Haplo found a piece of wood, caught hold of it, used it to keep himself afloat. He paddled in the water, stared around, attempted to get his bearings, and saw, with relief, the top of Council Hall. It stood on a hill and would be the last place to be submerged by the rising tides. There, undoubtedly, the Sartan had taken refuge. He squinted in the sunlight that sparkled off the water, thought he could detect people on the roof. They would keep themselves dry, free of the magic-debilitating seawater as long as possible.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t fight it,&#x201d; he advised them, though they were much too far away to hear him. &#x201c;It only makes it worse, in the end.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> At least now he had some idea where he was. He propelled himself forward, heading for the tops of the city walls that he could see thrusting up out of the water. The walls divided the Sartan portion of the city from what had once been the mensch portion. And beyond that lay the shoreline of the Chalice; the shoreline and mensch landing parties and a ship to carry him to Draknor. On that tortured seamoon was moored his own dwarven submersible, altered with the magic of the runes, strengthened to carry him through Death&#x2019;s Gate. His only hope of escape.<br> &nbsp;<br> But also, on Draknor, the serpents.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If so,&#x201d; he said to the dog, who was paddling along valiantly, front paws working like a small machine, back legs not quite certain what to make of this strange swimming business but doing their best to hold up their end, &#x201c;this is going to be one short trip.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> His plans were vague, couldn&#x2019;t be formed until he knew where the snakes were&nbsp;...&nbsp;and how to avoid them.<br> &nbsp;<br> He pushed forward, balanced on the wood, kicking through the water. He could have abandoned the plank and given himself to the sea, breathing it as effortlessly as air. But he detested those first few moments of terror that came with purposefully drowning oneself, the body refusing to accept the mind&#x2019;s reassurance that it was only returning to the womb, to a world it had once known. He clung to the plank, kicked until his legs ached.<br> &nbsp;<br> It occurred to him suddenly that this plank was an ominous sign. Unless he was much mistaken, it had come from one of the wooden dwarven submersibles, and it had been broken, both ends splintered.<br> &nbsp;<br> Had the serpents become bored with this peaceful takeover of Surunan, then turned on and butchered the mensch?<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If so,&#x201d; Haplo muttered, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got myself to blame for it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He kicked harder, faster, needing desperately to find out what was happening. But he soon tired, his muscles burned and cramped. He was swimming against the tide, against the flow of the seawater that was being channeled into the city. The loss of his magic made him feel unusually weak; he knew that from past bitter experience.<br> &nbsp;<br> The tide carried him up against the city walls. He caught hold of a turret, climbed up the side, planning not only to rest but to reconnoiter, to try to catch a glimpse of what lay ahead on the shore. The dog attempted to stop, but the current carried it on past. Haplo leaned out at a perilous angle, caught hold of the dog by the scruff of its neck. He hauled it in&#x2014;the animal&#x2019;s back legs scrabbling for purchase&#x2014;and heaved it up onto the balustrade with him.<br> &nbsp;<br> From this vantage point, he had an excellent view of the harbor of Surunan, the shoreline beyond that. Haplo looked out, nodded grimly.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We needn&#x2019;t have worried, boy,&#x201d; he said, smacking the dog&#x2019;s wet and shaggy flank. &#x201c;At least they&#x2019;re safe.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The animal grinned, shook itself.<br> &nbsp;<br> The fleet of mensch submersibles was drawn up in a more or less orderly line in the harbor. The sun-chasers bobbed on the surface. Mensch lined the bows, pointing and shouting, leaning over the rails, jumping into the water. Numerous small boats plied back and forth between ship and shore, probably ferrying the dwarves, who could not swim. The humans and elves&#x2014;far more at home in the water&#x2014;were directing the work of several huge whales, pushing crudely built, heavily loaded rafts into the harbor.<br> &nbsp;<br> Eyeing the rafts, Haplo glanced down at the wooden plank that he&#x2019;d dragged up with him. That&#x2019;s why they&#x2019;d broken up the submersibles. The mensch were moving in.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But&nbsp;...&nbsp;where are the serpents?&#x201d; he asked the dog, who lay, panting, at his feet.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nowhere in sight, apparently. Haplo watched as long as he could, driven by the need to escape this world and return to the Nexus and his lord, yet constrained by the equal need to reach that world alive. Patience, caution&#x2014;hard lessons to learn, but the Labyrinth was an excellent teacher.<br> &nbsp;<br> He saw no sign of serpent heads looming out of the water. Perhaps they were all under the surface, boring the holes into the foundation of the Chalice through which the seawater was pouring.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I need to find out,&#x201d; Haplo said to himself in frustration. If the snakes knew he was free and was planning to flee Chelestra, they&#x2019;d stop him, if they could.<br> &nbsp;<br> He weighed the alternatives. Taking time to talk to the mensch meant delay, risked revealing his presence to them. They&#x2019;d welcome him with joy, want to hang on to him, use him. He didn&#x2019;t have time to fool with the mensch. But not taking the time to find out what was going on with the serpents might mean an even greater delay&#x2014;perhaps a deadly one.<br> &nbsp;<br> He waited several moments, hoping for some sign of the snakes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nothing. And he couldn&#x2019;t stay on this damn wall forever.<br> &nbsp;<br> Deciding to trust to opportunity, Haplo plunged back into the water. The dog, with a wild bark, splashed in beside him.Volume five of the apparently interminable Death Gate Cycle (Serpent Mage, 1992, etc.). Now that the evil-magic serpents of the water-world Chelestra have escaped through the Death Gate, new power alliances are possible--such as that between the serpents and Xar, Haplo's powerful Patryn boss. Despite Haplo's feeble warnings about the serpents' malevolent intentions (they can assume any shape, retaining only tell-tale red eyes), Xar dispatches Haplo and his yappy-dog sidekick to the air-world Arianus, with orders to set species against species and generally create chaos among the lower- order ``mensch.'' And this time Haplo's old rival/accomplice, Albert the Sartan, languishes trapped inside the Labyrinth. So, by himself Haplo must somehow stop the elf-dwarf war by helping the human and elf magicians while placating Xar and devising a means to repel the serpents--oh, yes, and preventing various assassinations, including his own. A hypercomplicated plot whose increasingly improbable convolutions seem designed only to distract attention from the ludicrously implausible scenario, plodding narrative, and irritatingly obtuse characters. Which, being translated into Fannish, means: another smash hit. (First printing of 60,000) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

A man insensible of his own leg pistoning up and down, tapping <i>tat-tat-tat-tat-tat</i> on the floor. At Boylston Street the track curved, the steel wheels shrieked against the rails, and the lights flickered off. Passengers let their eyes close, like a congregation beginning a silent prayer. When the lights came on again and their eyes opened, Ricky Daley was watching them.<br><br>At Park Street station, Ricky jogged up the stairs to the street, into a stagnant crowd. Offices had closed early, creating an early rush hour, but there was nowhere to go. The news was everywhere, still sensational though everyone had already heard it. Newsboys squawked &#x201c;Extra!&#x201d; and &#x201c;Read it <i>hee</i>-yuh!&#x201d; and &#x201c;Exclusive!&#x201d; They lingered on the hissing alien word &#x201c;Ass-<i>sass</i>-inated!&#x201d; Over on Tremont Street, crowds clumped against parked cars to listen to the news on WBZ; they bowed their heads toward the car radios. But there was no real news, no one knew anything, so eventually they turned away, they loitered on the sidewalk, and shambled in and out of the Common. It was midafternoon, three hours or so <i>after</i>&#x2013;after President Kennedy first slapped at his neck as if he&#x2019;d been stung by a bee&#x2013;three hours after but the concussed mood was not dissipating. It was deepening, and more and more the stupor was infused with anxiety: What was next? From what direction would the attack come? How in the hell would they all get through this?<br><br>Ricky strolled right through them, working his way west. It was quieter in the Common, away from the street. No one seemed to be speaking. No one knew what to say. In the quiet he could make out the murmur of the city, distant engines and car horns and cops&#x2019; whistles. He wore a gray overcoat and an itchy hundred-and-twenty-five-dollar suit. His shoes, new black brogans, made squinching sounds when he walked. He had tried to soften them by wearing them around his apartment, but they still pinched across the top of his feet. He had succeeded, at least, in dulling the gloss of the leather by rubbing it with saliva. The shoes should look polished but not new. New shoes might draw attention.<br><br>By the Frog Pond, a woman on a slatted park bench held a handkerchief to her mouth, balled up in her fist. Her eyes were watery. Ricky stopped to offer her the stiff new handkerchief tri-folded in his jacket pocket.<br><br>&#x201c;Here,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m alright.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Go on, I don&#x2019;t use them. It&#x2019;s just for show.&#x201d;<br><br>Ricky gazed up, granting her the privacy to mop her nose.<br><br>&#x201c;Who would do such a thing?&#x201d; The woman sniffled.<br><br>Ricky looked down again, and he detected a shy grin at the corners of her mouth. Smile, he thought. Go on.<br><br>&#x201c;Who would do this?&#x201d;<br><br>Go ahead and smile. Because who could deny there was a little secret pleasure in it? Kennedy was dead, but they had never felt quite so alive. All these nine-to-five suckers, all the secretaries and waitresses and Edison men&#x2013;it was as if they had all been drowsing for years only to snap awake, here, together, inside this Great Day. Ricky thought that, if he wanted to, he could explore this girl for information (where did she work? did she have a key? was there an opportunity there?). She was available. Probably she felt a little intoxicated by this feeling of nowness. Until today, she had never felt so thrillingly present in each moment. It was a limitation of human consciousness: We live only in the future and past, we cannot perceive <i>now</i>. <i>Now</i> occupies no space, a hypothetical gap between future and past. Only an exceptional few could feel <i>now</i>, athletes and jazzmen and, yes, thieves like Ricky Daley, and even for them the sensation was fleeting, limited to the instant of creative action. Cousy knew the feeling; Miles Davis, too. The boundless improvisational moment. Today this girl was experiencing it, and she wanted to share the experience even with a stranger. Well, Ricky figured, it made sense&#x2013;Kennedy&#x2019;s murder was exciting. It was a good day to work.<br><br>&#x201c;Castro,&#x201d; she decided. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all I can think, is Castro.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I messed up your handkerchief. I&#x2019;m sorry. Must be expensive.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay. I stole it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You . . . ? Oh.&#x201d; She smiled, appraising him. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re very nice. What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a long story.&#x201d;<br><br>He left her there. He walked on through the Public Garden. His breath made little clouds in the cold.<br><br>At Arlington Street, the doors to the church were propped open. The interior was warm and eggshell white. Through the open doors, Ricky could see an organist, a young man with flushed cheeks and a lick of blond hair that flopped in his eyes until he flipped it back with a toss of his head like a horse. The young man played in a sort of rapture. His eyes were shut, his torso swayed expressively.<br><br>Ricky walked on, west through the Back Bay, in a series of zigs and zags. On the residential side streets, he turned each corner, stopped, and looked back for a good long while. He hadn&#x2019;t noticed any tails, but you never knew. Even on a day like this, with everyone smashed by the news, cops included, it was important to maintain your technique.<br><br>At the Copley Plaza Hotel, a doorman in a long overcoat with gold braiding and epaulettes held the door. &#x201c;Good afternoon, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Afternoon.&#x201d; Ricky took care to glance at the man only for an instant.<br><br>He moved quickly through the lobby, but not too quickly. Purposeful, proprietary, calibrating his movements to the room. He had a fingerman at the front desk, who gave Ricky a nod.<br><br>On the house phone he dialed room 404. No answer.<br><br>He sauntered into the Oak Room to wait at the bar for fifteen minutes, to be sure. A guest might go back up to his room for a forgotten item in the first few minutes after walking out, but he almost never returned once he&#x2019;d been out for a quarter hour or more. Ricky made a point of checking his coat and tipping the girl a quarter. At the bar he ordered a highball and settled in. Rather than gawk at the luxurious room with its carved plaster ceiling and heavy furniture, he watched the door. He folded his arms across his chest, straining his suit jacket, because he&#x2019;d noticed that rich people were comfortable in their expensive clothes. They wore a good suit as if it were an old sweater. They didn&#x2019;t care.<br><br>After a half hour of this business, pleased with the way he&#x2019;d blended into the herd (no one, not even the bartender, would remember him later), he called room 404 again on the house phone and again got no answer. He drained his highball and in a tipsy voice he told the bartender an old joke&#x2013;about the giraffe who walks into a bar and announces, &#x201c;The highballs are on me&#x201d;&#x2013;before leaving. The bartender&#x2019;s face puckered: Didn&#x2019;t this jackass know Kennedy was dead?<br><br>Elevator to the fourth floor.<br><br>At room 404 he gave a brushy knock, then took a key from his pocket and let himself in.<br><br>He checked the room. Empty.<br><br>Back to the door. Gloves on. A glance up and down the hallway. He took a paper clip from his pocket, broke an inch of wire from it, slid the wire into the keyhole to plug it, then closed the door.<br><br>Checked the dresser. Checked the closets. He worked quickly but without noise and without leaving a mess. Found what he was looking for duct-taped to the inside of the toilet tank (clever prick): a yellow silk jewelry bag.<br><br>Ricky emptied the bag onto the bed. Loose diamonds. Some small jewelry pieces. Packets of hundred-dollar bills, banded. He separated out some of the jewelry, the gold plate, the pieces too bulky to conceal. That left a glassy heap. There might have been a half million dollars mounded up there. A cool little cone of diamonds.<br><br>The corners of Ricky&#x2019;s mouth tried to curl up into the tiniest unprofessional smirk, which he smothered.</p><h2>Texas Fury: A Novel</h2><p>From the exotic traditions of the Far East to the troubled oil fields of Texas, from the paradise landscapes of Hawaii to the snow-covered mountains of Switzerland . . . the lives, loves, and fates of the Colemans all come together in the name of family and in the name of their unforgettable Texas dynasty.</p><p><b>Fern Michaels</b> is the author of more than fifty novels, including the Texas quartet&#x2013;<i>Texas Rich, Texas Heat</i>, <i>Texas Fury, </i>and<i> Texas Sunrise</i>&#x2013;as well as the Captive series of historical romances.

This was real French satin ribbon, specially ordered by Amelia Coleman Assante and trimmed with a half inch of Spanish lace. Yards of the opulent ribbon festooned the sequined pylons that were manned by a pair of handsome guards wearing well-fitted cobalt-blue uniforms. The shears, while not overly large for such a momentous occasion, were solid gold. &#x201c;Nothing but the best for this opening,&#x201d; Amelia cooed to her husband. &#x201c;The crowd expects it. Smile, darling. We&#x2019;re going live.&#x201d; Cary Assante looked up at the tiny figure standing on top of Assante Towers. He watched as one of the cameramen signalled to the commentator who waited on top of the building.<br><br>&#x201c;This is Dave Harrison of KBT Eyewitness News reporting to you live from atop Assante Towers in downtown Austin. All you armchair viewers should be glad you&#x2019;re viewing this dedication in your warm living rooms. Today&#x2019;s temperature is well below the freezing mark. A record breaker, ladies and gentlemen, but a nice way to start off the Christmas season. I&#x2019;ll be switching you to Neal Tyler, my associate, in just a minute, but first I want to tell you a little bit about today&#x2019;s groundbreaking ceremonies. Cary Assante, the creator of this architectural immensity, this city-within-a-city known as Miranda, will be cutting the ribbon shortly. I was told before airtime that a large crowd was not expected due to this record-breaking cold, but there must be a thousand people down there. Cary Assante is married to Amelia Coleman, and here in Texas, anything the Colemans are involved in is major news. This affair today, ladies and gentlemen, takes the spotlight away from the oil crisis that&#x2019;s paralyzed our state for so long.<br><br>&#x201c;The governor and the lieutenant governor are here, as well as the newly appointed mayor of Miranda. Yes, Miranda will have its own mayor, and even its own zip code. Senator Thad Kingsley of Vermont is in attendance with his beautiful wife, Billie, who was once married to Moss Coleman. Two of our own congressmen are here, and every socialite in the register is down there, all wearing their best furs. The Crystal City Band is down there, too, as well as the fire department and rescue squad.<br><br>&#x201c;This is a wonderful turnout for Cary Assante, who worked more than ten years to complete this magnificent city within a city. KBT News will be taking you inside Assante Towers tonight for the gala opening in the grand ballroom. The color scheme for tonight&#x2019;s festivities is red and silver, with over fifty thousand poinsettia plants flown here from San Diego. Special heaters were required for the planes and the trucks that transported the plants. It&#x2019;s obvious that no expense was spared for this momentous occasion. And the crowd down below is loving it. This is Dave Harrison, reporting live from Miranda. Back to you, Neal.&#x201d;<br><br>The Crystal City marching band swung into its third lusty rendition of &#x201c;Deep in the Heart of Texas&#x201d; as Cary Assante and local dignitaries mounted the beribboned dedication platform outside the Miranda Tourist and Information Center. The new mayor of Miranda drew himself up to his full six foot four inches. Thin streams of vapor escaped his pursed lips. He tried valiantly not to shiver in the record-breaking cold, but was failing miserably. His teeth chattered as he made his short speech, which was amplified by an echoing sound system.<br><br>&#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen, this is indeed a proud day for all of us. This marvelous state-of-the-art complex that has taken ten years and billions of dollars to build is your inner city. You who are privileged to live here will never have to stray outside these boundaries. The creators of this masterpiece have thought of everything. But I won&#x2019;t keep you out in this cold or in suspense any longer&#x2014;I suggest Mr. Assante cut the ribbon right now! I look forward to seeing you all this evening for the gala in Assante Towers. And now,&#x201d; the mayor shouted, &#x201c;the creator of Miranda, Mr. Cary Assante.&#x201d;<br><br>Cary stepped forward, Amelia at his side. Her smile was brilliant and full of pride as she handed her husband the gold shears. &#x201c;This is your moment, darling. Your dream is officially a reality.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Our dream, babe,&#x201d; Cary whispered. His hand trembled as he cut the shimmering ribbon. He felt light-headed. All about him was a babble of congratulatory voices. The band members made a valiant effort to render still another chorus of &#x201c;Deep in the Heart of Texas.&#x201d;<br><br>Amelia stepped back. This was Cary&#x2019;s time, and he deserved all the accolades. All she wanted was to find Billie and Thad and get inside, where it was warm.<br><br>Amelia Coleman Assante possessed the kind of beauty that comes only with maturity and being at peace with oneself. She was tall, but not as tall as her handsome husband. She carried her height with dignity and dressed to that dignity with carefully chosen designer clothes that masked a thinness that spoke of past health problems. Her soft gray eyes were almost translucent, a perfect complement to her hair, which was more silver now than chestnut. The fine lines around her eyes and the deeper creases alongside her nose spoke more of character than age, as did the light brown spots unsuccessfully covered with makeup. Perfectly white capped teeth, slightly yellowed now from medication and too much tea, nibbled on a thin lower lip to stop it from trembling with the cold. To those standing in the crowd who knew her, she was every bit as striking and commanding as she&#x2019;d been in her earlier days.<br><br>Billie Coleman Kingsley hugged her sister-in-law. &#x201c;He really did it, Amelia. I&#x2019;m so proud. You must be about ready to burst!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am. There were times, Billie, when I thought this was nothing more than a nightmare, but Cary can do whatever he sets his mind to.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What do you think, Senator Kingsley?&#x201d;<br><br>Thad laughed. &#x201c;What I think is, I&#x2019;m glad I invested in this project.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That makes two of us,&#x201d; said Amelia, smiling. &#x201c;Without you we&#x2019;d have run out of money years ago. By the way, where is Mr. Hasegawa? I want to thank him for coming all the way from Japan. He really isn&#x2019;t well enough to be traveling. We also have to thank him for his investment. We really did it, thanks to the two of you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Hasegawa is with Sawyer,&#x201d; Billie said. &#x201c;I thinks he&#x2019;s taking him back to Sunbridge. He&#x2019;s very tired after his long flight, and he isn&#x2019;t feeling well. But he&#x2019;ll be back tonight for the festivities.&#x201d; Billie paused a moment, and when she spoke again, her voice was full of awe. &#x201c;Amelia, I&#x2019;ve never seen anything like this, and Thad and I have been all over the world.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You look tired, Amelia,&#x201d; Thad said, his brow furrowing, his voice full of concern.<br><br>Amelia smiled. &#x201c;Now, I don&#x2019;t want to be fussed over,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine. The doctor says I&#x2019;m fully recovered from the surgery. I just hate being cold. And before you can say it, I&#x2019;m going upstairs and rest for tonight&#x2019;s gala. I really am excited about the library dedication. It was Cary&#x2019;s idea, you know, to dedicate it to Mam. The Jessica Coleman Library. What are you going to do?&#x201d; Amelia asked Billie as she bussed her on the cheek.<br><br>&#x201c;Corral the family and take the tour, like everyone else.&#x201d; Billie watched as Amelia headed toward the gleaming bank of elevators.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll meet you by the jitney,&#x201d; Thad called over his shoulder.<br><br>Instead of moving off through the crowds, Billie remained where she was, her thoughts on Amelia. She didn&#x2019;t look well, and it was more than simple fatigue. Regardless of what she said, it was obvious that the heart bypass surgery had taken its toll. A brief, sharp spasm of worry overcame Billie. She and Amelia were more than sisters-in-law; they&#x2019;d been intimate friends for over forty years.<br><br>Billie&#x2019;d been so young when she met Amelia for the first time, only eighteen, and so very much in love with Amelia&#x2019;s brother, Moss. She&#x2019;d been scared, too, of Moss and Amelia&#x2019;s father, Seth. What a tyrant he was. Amelia had confided in her, and in turn, she&#x2019;d shared her life with Amelia. They were more like sisters than sisters-in-law, drawing together out of need, giving and accepting one another&#x2019;s friendship, sharing triumphs and disappointments.<br><br>Forty years of memories leapfrogged through Billie&#x2019;s mind. Accompanying Amelia to a back-street abortionist while she herself was secretly pregnant. Seth&#x2019;s hatred of Amelia because she&#x2019;d had the audacity to be born a female. Amelia consoling her when Seth treated her like a brood mare, demanding that she produce a son&#x2014;an heir.<br><br>While the war raged in England and Amelia couldn&#x2019;t return to the States in time for her mother&#x2019;s funeral, Billie had stood in her place and prayed for Jessica, just as Amelia would have done.<br><br>And it was Amelia who encouraged her, after Moss&#x2019;s death, to become a designer. Thanks to Amelia&#x2019;s support and confidence, she&#x2019;d started her own successful business, Billie Ltd., an enterprise that had netted her a seven-figure yearly income.<br><br>Until Amelia&#x2019;s marriage to Cary Assante, Billie had felt she was the only one who truly understood Amelia. Amelia had survived her father&#x2019;s hatred of her. She&#x2019;d survived his bluster and his boasts that he had the United States government by the balls and someday they&#x2019;d make him a very rich man. How she&#x2019;d hated those boasts. She&#x2019;d survived war-torn England, and although she lost her husband in that war, she gained a stepson and raised the boy at Sunbridge. Rand&#x2014;who was now Billie&#x2019;s son-in-law. How close the bonds were. How long the connection. Forty years!<br><br>Forty years was half their life. If she had it to do over again, she wouldn&#x2019;t change a thing&#x2014;all the tragedies, the sorrows, the happiness that had brought them to this moment.<br><br>(<br><br>Thad exited the glass-enclosed elevator. Instead of heading for the jitney, he retraced his steps to the main concourse, where he&#x2019;d left Billie. He knew she&#x2019;d still be there. Thinking. How beautiful she was, so serene and gentle. His heart swelled with love. Every day of his life he thanked God for giving him the patience to wait for this woman&#x2014;this wonderful woman who had been his best friend&#x2019;s wife. Billie was his life. Not the navy, not Congress, and not the Senate. Billie. His partner, his wife, his love. In another year he&#x2019;d retire from the Senate, and then it would be just the two of them, back in Vermont. Remembering Amelia&#x2019;s recent illness, he prayed silently that nothing would happen to change their wonderful plans.<br><br>He knew scores of people, particularly on the Hill, couples who stayed together for political reasons, never letting their mutual disaffection show in public. That was what he despised about Washington&#x2014;all the blowhards, all the phoniness, the crap you had to wade through, only to find more crap. He was grateful to Billie for refusing to allow the fishbowl life to infringe on their private lives. Everyone on the Hill knew what he stood for, and there was envy in the lot of them, or so Billie said, and he had no reason to doubt her. Every time he heard tales of his colleagues&#x2019; misconduct he&#x2019;d shake his head and thank God again for Billie. The woman hadn&#x2019;t yet been born who could make him take a second look.<br><br>Billie was every bit as attractive as her sister-in-law, but with a very different kind of beauty. Hers came with sparkling eyes and vivid color, something she was known for in the fashion world. There was a mellowness, a happiness to Billie that shimmered about her like a giant halo. She was half a head shorter than Amelia and only a few pounds heavier. She glowed with good health, and when she smiled the world seemed lighter, brighter somehow. Billie was truly a happy woman, and it showed. High cheekbones lightly dusted with color and her perfectly shaped nose complemented warm hazel eyes that were her best feature. Today she wore a brilliant scarlet scarf with a sapphire fringe, a Billie original. She looked vibrant, vital.<br><br>Soon enough Billie would feel his eyes on her and turn, he thought. And the next moment she proved his thoughts were on target, as he used to say in the navy. Billie turned, her eyes searching the crowd. When she spotted him her face broke into a wide, lovely smile. He mouthed the command: &#x201c;Hold that smile.&#x201d; He could sense her laughter as he shouldered his way through the crowd.<br><br>&#x201c;I knew you&#x2019;d still be here,&#x201d; Thad said gently.<br><br>&#x201c;I know you knew. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m still here. I didn&#x2019;t want you to have to search for me and perhaps miss the tour jitney I was on. We want to do this together.&#x201d; He watched as a worried look shadowed her features. &#x201c;Oh, Thad, I should have come down here more often to see Amelia instead of relying on phone calls and letters. She looks&#x2014;&#x201d; she hesitated, seeking the right word, &#x201c;&#x2014;unwell.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Darling, Amelia hates to be fussed over, unless it&#x2019;s by Cary. Don&#x2019;t take any blame. This last week had to be exhausting for her. She&#x2019;ll take a few days off now and she&#x2019;ll recoup.&#x201d; He felt her begin to tense. &#x201c;No, Billie, I&#x2019;m not just saying that to make you feel better,&#x201d; he said, reading her mind. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not discounting the seriousness of her surgery or her recovery, but I&#x2019;m sure Cary, or Amelia herself, would have said something to us if things weren&#x2019;t . . . up to par. A cup of herb tea and a nap will perk her right up.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t believe that any more than I do,&#x201d; Billie said.<br><br>&#x201c;We have to believe it, Billie.&#x201d;<br><br>Billie clutched his arm tightly, her eyes growing moist. &#x201c;I know, Thad. We&#x2019;ve lost so many old friends, and now Mr. Hasegawa so ill . . . and Amelia.&#x201d;<br><br>There weren&#x2019;t any words, and Thad didn&#x2019;t try to search for them. He circled her shoulders with his free arm and hugged her tight.<br><br>Billie took a long, deep breath and came back to the present. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s round up the family, if they haven&#x2019;t already taken their own tour!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Now, that&#x2019;s an offer I can&#x2019;t refuse. I can&#x2019;t wait to see this place we helped build. I had trouble, darling, comprehending Cary&#x2019;s vision of this complex. I mean, I saw the plans and then the buildings as they were going up, but nothing prepared me for this glass and steel marvel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A city inside a city,&#x201d; Billie said. &#x201c;So self-contained. The outside world could seem like an alien planet if one wanted to live and die here. I don&#x2019;t know if that&#x2019;s good, Thad.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Choices. Options. They&#x2019;re available. I think it&#x2019;s wonderful for the elderly.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If they could afford to live here. Do you know what the rent is in Assante Towers? Five thousand a month, and it&#x2019;s got an eighty-five percent occupancy as of today.&#x201d;<br><br>Arm in arm, Thad and Billie climbed the broad steps of the center. At the top they stopped to peer into the crowd below.<br><br>&#x201c;Here we are, but I don&#x2019;t see any sign of Cole or Riley. I thought I saw Maggie a moment ago, but she&#x2019;s disappeared.&#x201d; Thad turned to look into his wife&#x2019;s eyes, a conspiratorial smile on his lips.<br><br>&#x201c;What say, pretty lady, that you and I take this little trip all by ourselves? And I&#x2019;ll hold your hand so you don&#x2019;t get nervous.&#x201d;<br><br>A tour guide, commandeered by Cary from Disney World, spoke cheerfully as he shepherded the first tour group into the building. Thad and Billie melted into it.<br><br>&#x201c;Let me start off by thanking you all for coming to this wonderful opening of ACH Enterprises,&#x201d; the guide was saying. &#x201c;For those of you who don&#x2019;t know what ACH stands for, it&#x2019;s Assante, Coleman, and Hasegawa. Mr. Cary Assante is the man who built Miranda, with the help of the Coleman and Hasegawa corporations. I don&#x2019;t think I need to tell any of you from Texas just who the Colemans are!&#x201d; Most of the crowd tittered knowingly. &#x201c;For those of you who don&#x2019;t know who Mr. Hasegawa is,&#x201d; the guide continued, &#x201c;he&#x2019;s the grandfather of Riley Coleman and the owner of a Japanese publishing conglomerate called Rising Sun.</p><h2>The Racial Imaginary: Writers on Race in the Life of the Mind</h2><p><p>"To think of creativity in terms of transcendence is itself specific and partial&#x2014;a lovely dream perhaps, but an inhuman one.</p><p>"It is not only white writers who make a prize of transcendence, of course. Many writers of all backgrounds see the imagination as ahistorical, as a generative place where race doesn't and shouldn't enter, a place of bodies that transcend the legislative, the economic&#x2014;in other words, transcend the stuff that doesn't lend itself much poetry. In this view the imagination is postracial, a posthistorical and postpolitical utopia. . . .

We now realize that it&#x2019;s not really telling us that &#x201c;weird&#x201d; things happen out of sight, on the tiniest level, in the atomic world: rather, everything is quantum. But if quantum mechanics is correct, what seems obvious and right in our everyday world is built on foundations that don&#x2019;t seem&nbsp;obvious or right at all&#x2014;or even possible.<br><br> An exhilarating tour of the contemporary quantum landscape,&nbsp;<i>Beyond Weird</i>&nbsp;is a book about what quantum physics really means&#x2014;and what it doesn&#x2019;t. Science writer Philip Ball offers an up-to-date, accessible account of the quest to come to grips with the most fundamental theory of physical reality, and to explain how its counterintuitive principles underpin the world we experience. Over the past decade it has become clear that quantum physics is less a theory about particles and waves, uncertainty and fuzziness, than a theory about information and knowledge&#x2014;about what can be known, and how we can know it.&nbsp; Discoveries and experiments over the past few decades have called into question the meanings and limits of space and time, cause and effect, and, ultimately, of knowledge itself. The quantum world Ball shows us isn&#x2019;t a different world. It is our world, and if anything deserves to be called &#x201c;weird,&#x201d; it&#x2019;s us.</p><p><b>Philip Ball</b> is a writer, author, and broadcaster, and was formerly an editor at <i>Nature</i>. His writing on scientific subjects has appeared in places ranging from <i>New Scientist</i> to the<i> New York Times</i>. He is the author of more than twenty books, including <i>Invisible</i>, <i>Curiosity</i>, and, most recently, <i>The Water Kingdom: A Secret History of China</i>, also published by the University of Chicago Press. He lives in London.&#x201c;Ball&#x2019;s gorgeously lucid text takes us to the edge of contemporary theorizing about the foundations of quantum mechanics. <i>Beyond Weird</i> is easily the best book I&#x2019;ve read on the subject.&#x201d; (Washington Post)<br><br><p>"The intention of <i>Beyond Weird</i>, though, is not simply to provide a dummy&#x2019;s guide&nbsp;to the theory, but to explore its underlying meaning. We know that the equations work, but what sort of world do they really represent?&nbsp;To tackle the question, he weighs up the competing interpretations, and the misconceptions, that have attached themselves to quantum theory in its 100-year history, finishing with more recent attempts to rebuild the theory 'from scratch', and new ideas that offer tantalising glimpses beyond. . . . [A] laudable achievement."</p> (<i>Sunday Times</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;[A] clear and deeply researched account of what&#x2019;s known about the quantum laws of nature, and how to think about what they might really mean.&#x201d; (<i>Nature</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;An excellent account of modern quantum theory and the efforts being made to harness its effects.&#x201d; (<i>The Spectator</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;It would be easy to think 'Surely we don't need another book on quantum physics.' There are loads of them. . . . Don't be fooled, though - because in&nbsp;<i>Beyond Weird</i>, Philip Ball has done something rare in my experience. . .it makes an attempt not to describe quantum physics, but to explain why it is the way it is.&#x201d; (<i>PopScience Books</i>)<br><br>"If so great a physicist as Richard Feynman once claimed that 'nobody understands quantum mechanics,' what hope do we laypeople have? Luckily, Philip Ball, a freelance writer (formerly of Nature magazine) who has published widely on the history of science, tackles the subject in a user-friendly yet thorough introduction. . . . Replacing 'obscure terminology' with accessible ideas and drawings, Ball makes would-be physicists of us all."<br> &nbsp; (<i>Foreword Review</i>)<br><br>"Ball . . . asks lots of questions, including rhetorical ones, and uses words like 'we' and 'let's' to turn readers into collaborators. The tone is reassuring; he never talks down to nonscientists. Instead, he invites them to join in exploring this 'new and unfamiliar logic' in which what we understand and how we measure something has an effect on what we observe. Replacing 'obscure terminology' with accessible ideas and drawings, Ball makes would-be physicists of us all." (<i>Foreword Reviews</i>)<br><br>"Philip Ball is one of the finest contemporary writers about science. . . . His prose is a pleasure to read." (<i>Wall Street Journal</i>)</p><h2>Aristotle: Poetics</h2><p><p>A complete translation of Aristotle's classic that is both faithful and readable, along with an introduction that provides the modern reader with a means of understanding this seminal work and its impact on our culture. In this volume, Joe Sachs (translator of Aristotle's <i>Physics, Metaphysics,</i> and the <i>Nicomachean Ethics </i>)also supplements his excellent translation with well-chosen notes and glossary of important terms.</p><p>Focus Philosophical Library translations are close to and are non-interpretative of the original text, with the notes and a glossary intending to provide the reader with some sense of the terms and the concepts as they were understood by Aristotle&#x2019;s immediate audience.</p></p><p><p>Modern students can now appreciate the wisdom of the world&#x2019;s greatest thinkers. Through clear, faithful translations in the Focus Philosophical Library, renowned scholars have made modern and classical philosophical texts accessible and inspirational.</p><p><b>From the Introduction</b><br>Some of the most exhilarating things an educated person can think about come tumbling out of Aristotle&#x2019;s inquiry into the questions of what a tragedy is, what it does, and how it does it. In the Poetics a human achievement of rare power and a thinker of rare depth met, and the world has never stopped talking about their encounter.</p><p>&#x201c;I find the Introduction extremely convincing, lucid, learned, fair to past scholarship, and truly illuminating about the meaning of tragedy in general and about the very specific acceptions of hamartia, katharsis, ekpl�xis, and thauma, in the context of an appropriate understanding of the Poetics. Another remarkable feature is the dexterity and ease with which it draws on all the relevant parts of the Aristotelian corpus to shed light on troublesome textual passages in the Poetics. Finally, the style of the Introduction is straightforward, free of unnecessary jargon, direct, and economical, the best interpretation of the Poetics I ever read.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Sabetai Unguru, Tel Aviv University</p><p>&#x201c;The translations of Joe Sachs are a great gift to Greekless amateurs like me. He uses simple, unambiguous words joined into sentences that are often complex, as they must be to be accurate, but always clear (after sufficient attention has been paid). A stylist may find some awkwardness in the hyphenated compound words and the noun clauses he prefers to the polysyllabic Latinate words often found in English versions of Aristotle. But these blunt locutions &#x2014; along with Sachs&#x2019; excellent notes &#x2014; manage to convey both the richness of meaning and the clarity of thought of their Greek antecedents. The resulting translation may strike some as awkward in style, but it will strike the careful reader who cares about what is translated as elegant (in the way mathematicians use that word).&#x201d;<br>Jerry L.

Here, in this special double edition, the arrogant, gourmandizing, sedentary sleuth and his trusty man-about-town, Archie Goodwin, solve two of their most bizarre cases.<br><b><br>Some Buried Caesar<br></b>A prize bull destined for the barbecue is found pawing the corpse of a late restaurateur. Wolfe is certain that Hickory Caesar Grindon, the soon-to-be-beefsteak bull, isn&#x2019;t the murderer. But who among a veritable stampede of suspects&#x2014;including a young woman who&#x2019;s caught Archie&#x2019;s eye&#x2014;turned the tables on Hickory&#x2019;s would-be butcher? It&#x2019;s a crime that wins a blue ribbon for sheer audacity&#x2014;and Nero Wolfe is the one detective audacious enough to solve it. <br><b><br>The Golden Spiders</b><br>A twelve-year-old boy shows up at Wolfe&#x2019;s brownstone with an incredible story. Soon the great detective finds himself hired for the grand sum of $4.30 and faced with the question of why the last two people to hire him were murdered. To keep it from becoming three, Wolfe must discover the unlikely connection between a gray Cadillac, a mysterious woman, and a pair of earrings shaped like spiders dipped in gold.</p><p>Rex Stout, born 1886 in Indiana/USA, worked at thirty different professions until he earned enough money to travel. In 1932, he began to write thrillers focusing on the famous detective Nero Wolfe. Nero is a gourmet weighing more than a hundred kilos, and moving as little as possible. Rex Stout finished more than fifty novels and received the &#34;Grand Masters Award&#34;. He died 1975.<i>Chapter One</i><br>THAT SUNNY September day was full of surprises. The first one came when, after my swift realization that the sedan was still right side up and the windshield and windows intact, I switched off the ignition and turned to look at the back seat. I didn&#x2019;t suppose the shock of the collision would have hurled him to the floor, knowing as I did that when the car was in motion he always had his feet braced and kept a firm grasp on the strap; what I expected was the ordeal of facing a glare of fury that would top all records; what I saw was him sitting there calmly on the seat with his massive round face wearing a look of relief&#x2013;if I knew his face, and I certainly knew Nero Wolfe&#x2019;s face. I stared at him in astonishment.<br><br>He murmured, &#x201c;Thank God,&#x201d; as if it came from his heart. <br><br>I demanded, &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I said thank God.&#x201d; He let go of the strap and wiggled a finger at me. &#x201c;It has happened, and here we are. I presume you know, since I&#x2019;ve told you, that my distrust and hatred of vehicles in motion is partly based on my plerophory that their apparent submission to control is illusory and that they may at their pleasure, and sooner or later will, act on whim. Very well, this one has, and we are intact. Thank God the whim was not a deadlier one.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Whim hell. Do you know what happened?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Certainly. I said, whim. Go ahead.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What do you mean, go ahead?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I mean go on. Start the confounded thing going again.&#x201d;<br><br>I opened the door and got out and walked around to the front to take a look. It was a mess. After a careful examination I went back to the other side of the car and opened the rear door and looked in at him and made my report.<br><br>&#x201c;It was quite a whim. I&#x2019;d like to get it on record what happened, since I&#x2019;ve been driving your cars nine years and this is the first time I&#x2019;ve ever stopped before I was ready to. That was a good tire, so they must have run it over glass at the garage where I left it last night, or maybe I did myself, though I don&#x2019;t think so. Anyway, I was going 55 when the tire blew out. She left the road, but I didn&#x2019;t lose the wheel, and I was braking and had her headed up and would have made it if it hadn&#x2019;t been for that damn tree. Now the fender is smashed into the rubber and a knuckle is busted and the radiator&#x2019;s ripped open.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How long will it take you to fix it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t fix it. If I had a nail I wouldn&#x2019;t even bother to bite it, I&#x2019;d swallow it whole.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who can fix it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Men with tools in a garage.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t in a garage.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d;<br><br>He closed his eyes and sat. Pretty soon he opened them again and sighed. &#x201c;Where are we?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Two hundred and thirty-seven miles northeast of Times Square. Eighteen miles southwest of Crowfield, where the North Atlantic Exposition is held every year, beginning on the second Monday in September and lasting&#x2013;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Archie.&#x201d; His eyes were narrowed at me. &#x201c;Please save the jocularity. What are we going to do?&#x201d;<br><br>I admit I was touched. Nero Wolfe asking me what to do! &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know about you,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;m going to kill myself. I was reading in the paper the other day how a Jap always commits suicide when he fails his emperor, and no Jap has anything on me. They call it seppuku. Maybe you think they call it hara-kiri, but they don&#x2019;t or at least rarely. They call it seppuku.&#x201d;<br><br>He merely repeated, &#x201c;What are we doing to do?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to flag a car and get a lift. Preferably to Crowfield, where we have reservations at a hotel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Would you drive it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Drive what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The car we flag.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t imagine he would let me after he sees what I&#x2019;ve done to this one.&#x201d;<br><br>Wolfe compressed his lips. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t ride with a strange driver.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go to Crowfield alone and rent a car and come back for you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That would take two hours. No.&#x201d;<br><br>I shrugged. &#x201c;We passed a house about a mile back. I&#x2019;ll bum a ride there or walk, and phone to Crowfield for a car.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;While I sit here, waiting, helplessly, in this disabled demon.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d;<br><br>He shook his head. &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You won&#x2019;t do that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>I stepped back around the rear of the car to survey the surroundings, near and far. It was a nice September day, and the hills and dales of upstate New York looked sleepy and satisfied in the sun. The road we were on was a secondary highway, not a main drag, and nothing had passed by since I had bumped the tree. A hundred yards ahead it curved to the right, dipping down behind some trees. I couldn&#x2019;t see the house we had passed a mile or so back, on account of another curve. Across the road was a gentle slope of meadow which got steeper further up where the meadow turned into woods. I turned. In that direction was a board fence painted white, a smooth green pasture, and a lot of trees; and beyond the trees were some bigger ones, and the top of a house. There was no drive leading that way, so I figured that there would be one further along the road, around the curve.<br><br>Wolfe yelled to ask what the devil I was doing, and I stepped back to the car door.<br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see a garage anywhere. There&#x2019;s a house across there among those big trees. Going around by the road it would probably be a mile or more, but cutting across that pasture would be only maybe 400 yards. If you don&#x2019;t want to sit here helpless, I will, I&#x2019;m armed, and you go hunt a phone. That house over there is closest.&#x201d;<br><br>Away off somewhere, a dog barked. Wolfe looked at me. &#x201c;That was a dog barking.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Probably attached to that house. I&#x2019;m in no humor to contend with a loose dog. We&#x2019;ll go together. But I won&#x2019;t climb that fence.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You won&#x2019;t need to. There&#x2019;s a gate back a little way.&#x201d;<br><br>He sighed, and bent over to take a look at the crates, one on the floor and one on the seat beside him, which held the potted orchid plants. In view of the whim we had had, it was a good thing they had been secured so they couldn&#x2019;t slide around. Then he started to clamber out, and I stepped back to make room for him outdoors, room being a thing he required more than his share of. He took a good stretch, his applewood walking stick pointing like a sword at the sky as he did so, and turned all the way around, scowling at the hills and dales, while I got the doors of the car locked, and then followed me along the edge of the ditch to the place where we could cross to the gate.<br><br>It was after we had passed through, just as I got the gate closed behind us, that I heard the guy yelling. I looked across the pasture in the direction of the house, and there he was, sitting on top of the fence on the other side. He must have just climbed up. He was yelling at us to go back where we came from. At that distance I couldn&#x2019;t tell for sure whether it was a rifle or a shotgun he had with the butt against his shoulder. He wasn&#x2019;t exactly aiming it at us, but intentions seemed to be along that line. Wolfe had gone on ahead while I was shutting the gate, and I trotted up to him and grabbed his arm.<br><br>&#x201c;Hold on a minute. If that&#x2019;s a bughouse and that&#x2019;s one of the inmates, he may take us for woodchucks or wild turkeys&#x2013;&#x201d;<br><br>Wolfe snorted. &#x201c;The man&#x2019;s a fool. It&#x2019;s only a cow pasture.&#x201d; Being a good detective, he produced his evidence by pointing to a brown circular heap near our feet. Then he glared toward the menace on the fence, bellowed &#x201c;Shut up!&#x201d; and went on. I followed. The guy kept yelling and waving the gun, and we kept to our course, but I admit I wasn&#x2019;t liking it, because I could see now it was a shotgun and he might easily be the kind of a nut that would pepper us.<br><br>There was an enormous boulder, sloping up to maybe 3 feet above the ground, about exactly in the middle of the pasture, and we were a little to the right of that when the second surprise arrived in the series I spoke of. My attention was pretty thoroughly concentrated on the nut with the shotgun, still perched on the fence and yelling louder than ever, when I felt Wolfe&#x2019;s fingers gripping my elbow and heard his sudden sharp command:<br><br>&#x201c;Stop! Don&#x2019;t move!&#x201d;<br><br>I stopped dead, with him beside me. I thought he had discovered something psychological about the bird on the fence, but he said without looking at me, &#x201c;Stand perfectly still. Move your head slowly, very slowly, to the right.&#x201d;<br><br>For an instant I thought the nut with the gun had something contagious and Wolfe had caught it, but I did as I was told, and there was the second surprise. Off maybe 200 feet to the right, walking slowly toward us with his head up, was a bull bigger than I had supposed bulls came. He was dark red with white patches, with a big white triangle on his face, and he was walking easy and slow, wiggling his head a little as if he was nervous, or as if he was trying to shake a fly off of his horns. Of a sudden he stopped and stood, looking at us with his neck curved.<br><br>I heard Wolfe&#x2019;s voice, not loud, at the back of my head, &#x201c;It would be better if that fool would quit yelling. Do you know the technique of bulls? Did you ever see a bull fight?&#x201d;<br><br>I moved my lips enough to get it out: &#x201c;No, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>Wolfe grunted. &#x201c;Stand still. You moved your finger then, and his neck muscles tightened. How fast can you run?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can beat that bull to the fence. Don&#x2019;t think I can&#x2019;t. But you can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know very well I can&#x2019;t. Twenty years ago I was an athlete. This almost convinces me . . . but that can wait. Ah, he&#x2019;s pawing. His head&#x2019;s down. If he should start . . . it&#x2019;s that confounded yelling. Now . . . back off slowly, away from me. Keep facing him. When you are 10 feet away from me, swerve toward the fence. He will begin to move when you do. As long as he follows slowly, keep backing and facing him. When he starts his rush, turn and run&#x2013;&#x201d;<br><br>I never got a chance to follow directions. I didn&#x2019;t move, and I&#x2019;m sure Wolfe didn&#x2019;t, so it must have been our friend on the fence&#x2013;maybe he jumped off into the pasture. Anyhow, the bull curved his neck and started on the jump; and if it was the other guy he was headed for, that didn&#x2019;t help any, because we were in line with him and we came first. He started the way an avalanche ends. Possibly if we had stood still he would have passed by, about 3 feet to my right, but either it was asking too much of human nature to expect me to stand there, or I&#x2019;m not human. I have since maintained that it flashed through my mind that if I moved it would attract him to me and away from Nero Wolfe, but there&#x2019;s no use continuing that argument here. There&#x2019;s no question but what I moved, without any preliminary backing. And there&#x2019;s no question, whoever he started for originally, about his being attracted by my movement. I could hear him behind me. I could damn near feel him. Also I was dimly aware of shouts and a blotch of something red above the fence near the spot I was aimed at. There it was&#x2013;the fence. I didn&#x2019;t do any braking for it, but took it at full speed, doing a vault with my hands reaching for its top, and one of my hands missed and I tumbled, landing flat on the other side, sprawling and rolling. I sat up and panted and heard a voice above me: <br><br>&#x201c;Beautiful! I wouldn&#x2019;t have missed that for anything!&#x201d;<br><br>I looked up and saw two girls, one in a white dress and red jacket, the other in a yellow shirt and slacks. I snarled at them, &#x201c;Shall I do it again?&#x201d; The nut with the shotgun came loping up making loud demands, and I told him to shut up, and scrambled to my feet. The fence was 10 yards away. Limping to it, I took a look. The bull was slowly walking along, a hundred feet off, wiggling his head. In the middle of the pasture was an ornamental statue. It was Nero Wolfe, with his arms folded, his stick hanging from a wrist, standing motionless on the rounded peak of the boulder. It was the first time I had ever seen him in any such position as that, and I stood and stared because I had never fully realized what a remarkable looking object he really was. He didn&#x2019;t actually look undignified, but there was something pathetic about it, he stood so still, not moving at all.</p><h2>We&#39;re Sailing to Galapagos</h2><p>Tour the Galapagos Islands in a red-sailed boat and encounter many exotic land and sea animals, like giant tortoises, albatrosses, iguanas, lava crabs and booby birds!

We&#39;re Sailing to Galapagos is her first title for Barefoot Books.PreSchool-Grade 3&#x2013;A colorfully garbed couple take readers on a jaunty journey to the Galapagos Islands. For each day of the week, the rhymed text introduces one of the islands' unique animals. The repetition of the chorus "We're sailing to Galapagos. I wonder who we'll see" encourages audience participation. The bright collages create striking vistas that will also enhance group sharing. The youngest listeners will enjoy the visit to giant tortoises, black iguanas, and blue-footed boobies before they sail home. Older readers can learn more about the animals and Charles Darwin's famous exploration by perusing the informative entries following the rhyming section.

But the brothers&#x2019; talents found their most memorable outlet in their journal, which is at once a chronicle of an era, an intimate glimpse into their lives, and the purest expression of a nascent modern sensibility preoccupied with sex and art, celebrity and self-exposure. The Goncourts visit slums, brothels, balls, department stores, and imperial receptions; they argue over art and politics and trade merciless gossip with and about Hugo, Baudelaire, Degas, Flaubert, Zola, Rodin, and many others. And in 1871, Edmond maintains a vigil as his brother dies a slow and agonizing death from syphilis, recording every detail in the journal that he would continue to maintain alone for another two decades.</p><p><b>EDMOND DE GONCOURT </b>(1822-1896) and <b>JULES DE GONCOURT</b> (1830-1870) spent the majority of their lives in Paris. Having attended the finest schools, the Goncourts formed one of the most famous literary partnerships. After an unsuccessful novel and some attempts at drama, they began publishing books on various aspects of art and society in eighteenth-century France. Between 1860 and 1869 the brothers published six novels which they described as &#x201c;history which might have taken place&#x201d; and which were as carefully documented as their historical works. <br><br><b>ROBERT BALDICK</b> was a Fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford, and of the Royal Society of Literature.

What the fuck did Her Majesty think was going to happen?</p><p>&#x201c;Drink up lads,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s on the house, now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That it is,&#x201d; Bloody Anne said as she threw the innkeeper out of the door and locked it behind him.</p><p>He had wanted silver, for food and beer barely worth half a clipped copper. That was no way to welcome the returning heroes, to my mind, and it seemed Anne had agreed with me about that. She&#x2019;d given him a good kicking for his trouble.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s done then,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>Bloody Anne was my sergeant. Her hair was shorter than mine and she had a long, puckered scar that ran from the corner of her left eye down almost to the tip of her jaw, twisting the corner of her mouth into a permanent sneer. Nobody messed with Bloody Anne, not if they knew what was good for them.</p><p>&#x201c;You drinking?&#x201d; I asked, offering her a tankard.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d;</p><p>She had a gravelly voice that had been roughened by the smoke of blasting powder and too many years of shouting orders. No amount of beer would soften that voice, but that didn&#x2019;t stop her trying every chance she got. We sat at a table together and she took the cup from me and drained half of it in a single swallow.</p><p>A couple of the lads were dragging the innkeeper&#x2019;s daughter up some splintery wooden stairs while the others tapped a fresh cask. Kant grinned at me from those stairs, his hand already thrust down the front of the girl&#x2019;s kirtle. I shook my head to tell him no. I don&#x2019;t hold with rape and I wasn&#x2019;t allowing it, not in my crew.</p><p>I&#x2019;m a priest, after all.</p><p>Over Anne&#x2019;s shoulder, I watched Kant ignore me and drag the girl up onto the landing and out of sight. Those were the times we lived in.</p><p>All the same, there were limits.</p><p>I got to my feet and shoved the table away from me, spilling our wooden tankards of warm beer across the sawdust-covered floor of the inn.</p><p>&#x201c;Oi,&#x201d; Anne complained.</p><p>&#x201c;Kant!&#x201d; I shouted.</p><p>Kant stuck his head back around the rough plaster arch at the top of the stairs.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let the girl go,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Good one, boss.&#x201d;</p><p>He grinned, showing me his shit-colored teeth.</p><p>Bloody Anne turned in her seat and saw what was going on.</p><p>&#x201c;Enough, Corporal,&#x201d; she growled at him, but he ignored her.</p><p>It made me angry, that he thought he could ignore Anne like that. She was a sergeant and he was only a corporal, although that sort of thing didn&#x2019;t matter much anymore. Kant was a head taller than me and maybe thirty pounds heavier, but I didn&#x2019;t care. I knew that didn&#x2019;t matter either, and more to the point Kant knew it too. There was a devil in me, and all my crew knew it.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said, letting my voice fall into the flat tone that warned of harsh justice to come.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re joking,&#x201d; Kant said, but he sounded uncertain now.</p><p>&#x201c;Come here, Kant,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You too, Brak.&#x201d;</p><p>Spring rain blew against the closed shutters, loud in a room that was otherwise plunged into nervous silence. A smoky fire crackled in the grate. Kant and his fellow would-be rapist came back down the stairs, leaving the girl crying in a heap on the top step. She had maybe sixteen or seventeen years to her, no more than that, putting her at barely half my age.</p><p>I could feel Anne and the rest of my crew looking at me. Men set down their tankards and bottles to watch. Even Fat Luka put his cup down, and it took a lot to stop him drinking. The crew knew something had been ill done, and when something was ill done in my eyes there was always harsh justice.</p><p>Bloody Anne was giving me a wary look now. Sir Eland the false knight just stood there sneering at everyone like he always did, but he was watching too. Billy the Boy was halfway to drunk already, but then he was only twelve so I supposed I had to let him off not being able to hold his beer. Grieg and Cookpot and Black Billy and the others just watched.</p><p>I met Kant&#x2019;s eyes and pointed at a spot on the boards in front of me.</p><p>&#x201c;Come here,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Right now.&#x201d;</p><p>A log popped in the grate, making Simple Sam jump. Kant glared at me but he came, and Brak followed in his wake like a little boat trailing behind a war galleon.</p><p>&#x201c;Would you like someone to fuck, Kant?&#x201d; I asked him.</p><p>Kant was bigger than me, huge and ugly. Kant the Cunt, the crew called him, but never to his face. His chain-mail byrnie strained across his massive barrel chest over a jerkin of boiled leather. The scars on his face stood out livid and red as he started to get angry right back at me. I remembered how he had earned those scars at Abingon, forcing his way through the breach in the west wall when the citadel fell. Kant had led his squad over a mound of corpses, and never mind the archers waiting for them. He had taken an arrow through the cheek for his trouble. He had kept fighting, had Kant, spitting blood and teeth as he swung his mace into this head, that shoulder, those balls, crushing and bludgeoning and forcing his way forward. Bludgeon and force, that was how Kant the Cunt made his way in the world.</p><p>Kant was a war hero.</p><p>But then so was I.</p><p>&#x201c;Course I want someone to fuck,&#x201d; Kant said. &#x201c;Who don&#x2019;t?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You want to fuck, Kant?&#x201d; I asked him again, and this time my voice went soft and quiet.</p><p>All the crew had been with me long enough to know what that tone meant. That tone meant the devil was awake and there was harsh justice coming for sure, and soon. Kant was drunk, though, not booze drunk but rape drunk, power drunk, and I knew he wasn&#x2019;t going to take a telling. Not this time.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, I fucking do,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t like Kant. I never had liked Kant, truth be told, but Kant was a good soldier. In Abingon I had needed good soldiers. Now I needed good men, and the Lady only knows the two ain&#x2019;t necessarily the same thing.</p><p>&#x201c;Come here,&#x201d; I said again. &#x201c;If you want to fuck, come here and fuck me.&#x201d;</p><p>I held Kant&#x2019;s gaze. I wouldn&#x2019;t have put it past him, under other circumstances. If I had been some other man, some peasant lad, I doubted Kant would have been picky. A hole was a hole as far as he was concerned, and if he could stick his cock in it then it made him happy.</p><p>&#x201c;Tomas&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Anne started to say, but it was too late for that and I think she knew it.</p><p>The Weeping Women hung heavy on my hips. They were a matched pair of beautifully crafted shortswords that I had looted from a dead colonel after the last battle of Abingon. I had named them Remorse and Mercy.</p><p>My crew knew all too well what the Weeping Women could do in my hands.</p><p>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t ought to force yourself on lasses, it&#x2019;s not right,&#x201d; Black Billy said. He nudged the man beside him with his elbow. &#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t that so, Grieg?&#x201d;</p><p>Grieg grunted but said nothing. He was a man of few words, was Grieg.</p><p>&#x201c;Lady&#x2019;s sake,&#x201d; Brak muttered, scuffing his foot at the beery sawdust underfoot while Kant tried to stare me out. &#x201c;We was only having a bit of fun, like.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Does she look like she&#x2019;s having fun?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>Kant saw me point to the girl, he saw my eyes and hand move away from him, and he took his moment. I had thought he might, for all that I had hoped he had more sense. He was quick, was Kant, and he was brutal, but he wasn&#x2019;t any kind of clever.</p><p>He lunged at me, his hand going to his belt and coming out with a long knife in it. I dipped and turned, and swept Remorse out of her scabbard and across his throat in a vicious backhand cut. Kant dropped in a great spray of red foam, bubbling and cursing as he fell.</p><p>I could feel Billy the Boy looking at me.</p><p>&#x201c;Good fucking deal,&#x201d; he said, his voice not yet broken, and he drained his tankard.</p><p>&#x201c;Fuck,&#x201d; Brak said.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what you wanted, Brak,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;The offer&#x2019;s still open. My arse, if you can come and take it.&#x201d;</p><p>He looked at me, and at Kant bleeding out on the floor and at the length of dripping steel in my hand. He shook his head, and that was as I had expected. Brak was Kant&#x2019;s second, but he had barely twenty years to him and he was only tough when he had the big man in front of him.</p><p>&#x201c;Nah,&#x201d; he said at last. &#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t in the mood no more.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t think so,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>I wondered where this left Brak now, in the pecking order of my crew. Truth be told, I didn&#x2019;t care. That was Brak&#x2019;s problem, not mine. Staying boss was my problem&#x2014;how they sorted out their own hierarchy was up to them.</p><p>Matters of rank and the chain of command had gone to the whores after Abingon, but I had been the company priest. That put me in charge of the crew by default after the captain died of his wounds on the way home. That and I was used to leading men, and no one else was.</p><p>Simple Sam stood looking down at Kant for a long moment, then gave him a hefty kick as though checking to make sure he was dead.</p><p>He was.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the colonel going to say about this, Mr. Piety?&#x201d; Sam asked.</p><p>&#x201c;We ain&#x2019;t got a colonel anymore, Sam lad,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been disbanded, remember?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s disbanded?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Means they&#x2019;ve stopped paying us,&#x201d; Anne grumbled.</p><p>She was right. Our regiment had gone from being three thousand paid, organized murderers to three thousand unpaid, disorganized murderers.</p><p>That had gone about as well as might be expected.</p><p>&#x201c;Bollocks,&#x201d; Sam muttered, and kicked Kant again to show us what he thought of that.</p><p>The Lady only knew what had happened to our colonel, but the rest of us had stayed together in a loose mass of independent crews as a matter of habit more than anything else. There were nearly three thousand men camped in and around this town, but no one was really in charge anymore. No, I wouldn&#x2019;t be getting court-martialed for killing Kant. Not these days I wouldn&#x2019;t.</p><p>I looked down for a moment and gave thanks to Our Lady of Eternal Sorrows for my victory. She hadn&#x2019;t guided my hand, I knew that much. Our Lady doesn&#x2019;t help. Not ever. She doesn&#x2019;t answer prayers or grant boons or give a man anything at all, however hard he might pray for it. The best you can hope for from her is that she doesn&#x2019;t take your life today. Maybe tomorrow, aye, but not today. That&#x2019;s as good as it gets, and the rest is up to you.</p><p>She was a goddess for soldiers and no mistake.</p><p>&#x201c;Well done,&#x201d; Sir Eland the false knight said in my ear. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve kept them this time, at least.&#x201d;</p><p>He was a sneaky bastard, was Sir Eland. I hadn&#x2019;t known he was there until I felt his hot breath on the back of my neck. I turned and looked at him, carefully keeping a bland expression on my face. Sir Eland had been the captain&#x2019;s champion, this man who called himself a knight. He was nothing of the sort, I knew. He was just a thug who had stolen himself a warhorse and enough ill-fitting armor to carry off the lie. He was about as noble as my morning shit. All the same, he was dangerous and he needed watching.</p><p>&#x201c;Sir Eland,&#x201d; I said, and forced myself to smile at the false knight. &#x201c;How gratifying to have your support.&#x201d;</p><p>I turned away before he could say anything else. I could feel his eyes on my back, boring through my black hooded priest&#x2019;s robe and my chain-mail byrnie and boiled leather jerkin and linen shirt all the way through to my heart. Oh, yes, Sir Eland the false knight would stab me in the back the first chance he got, I knew that much. It was my job to not give him that chance. That was what it was, to be a leader of men like these.</p><p>At least Anne hated him as much as I did, that was something. I knew she had my back, she always did. I made my way across the inn to the table where Billy the Boy was sitting. Kant was still lying on the floorboards in a spreading pool of his own blood, but no one seemed to be in any sort of hurry to move him. I sat down at the scarred trestle table across from Billy, and nodded to him.</p><p>The lad looked up, the light catching the smooth planes of a face that had never seen a razor. A slow smile crept across his moist young lips.</p><p>&#x201c;Speak, in the name of Our Lady,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;I killed Kant,&#x201d; I confessed to him, keeping my voice low.</p><p>&#x201c;It was his time to cross the river,&#x201d; Billy said. &#x201c;The Lady knows Kant needed killing and she forgives you. In Our Lady&#x2019;s name.&#x201d;</p><p>He had, at that. No one would miss Kant, I knew that much.</p><p>Billy was only twelve years old but he wore mail and a shortsword like a man. I might be a priest, but Billy was my confessor, strange as that may seem. I bowed my head before the child.</p><p>&#x201c;In Our Lady&#x2019;s name,&#x201d; I repeated.</p><p>Billy the Boy reached out and brushed the cowl back from my face to put a hand on my forehead. It looked ridiculous, I knew, me giving confession to this child-man. I was the priest there, not him, but Billy was special. Billy was touched by Our Lady, all there knew that. That was the only reason the crew left a young lad like him alone. I remembered when Billy had first joined us, an orphan refugee from the sack of Messia. The regiment had been recruiting by then, replacing its losses, and had taken Billy even young as he was.</p><p>Sir Eland had taken a shine to him at once. He liked lads, did Sir Eland. He had tried to get into Billy&#x2019;s bedroll one night, to have his way with him. To this day I don&#x2019;t know exactly what had happened, and to be sure Sir Eland was never likely to raise the matter in conversation. All I remembered was a campfire by the roadside. I&#x2019;d had the watch that hour, and the rest of the crew were curled up asleep in their blankets as close to the fire as they could get. I remembered a sudden shrill scream in the darkness.</p><p>It hadn&#x2019;t been Billy who&#x2019;d screamed, but Sir Eland. Whatever he had tried to do to Billy, and I supposed really that was his business, his attention hadn&#x2019;t been wanted. Billy had done&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. something, and that had been the end of it. That was how the pecking order got worked out, and no one had ever mentioned it again. The crew adapted and moved on, and after that Billy the Boy was one of us.</p><p>The one touched by the goddess.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, Billy,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>He shrugged, indifferent. So simply was atonement given. There was no expression at all in his flat brown eyes, and Lady only knew what went on in his head.</p><p>I got up and looked around the room, my gaze taking in the rest of the crew. They were drinking and laughing and cursing once more, throwing dice and stuffing their faces with whatever Cookpot had found in the kitchen. At some point the girl had run away, and I thought that was wise of her. Simple Sam was being noisily sick in a corner. All was well.</p><p>Right up until six armed men kicked the door in, anyway.</p><p>&#x201c;Fuck!&#x201d; Brak shouted.</p><p>It was his favorite word, I had to give him that.</p><p>I sat quiet and stared at the newcomers as my crew drew steel all around me. I knew the one who led them, but I hadn&#x2019;t thought to see him again. I kept my hands on the table in front of me, well away from the hilts of the Weeping Women.</p><p>Six men shouldered their way inside with the rain blowing in behind them. Their leader shoved the hood of his sodden cloak back from his face and showed me a savage grin.</p><p>&#x201c;Fuck a nun, Tomas ...</p></p><h2>A Potter&#39;s Book</h2><p>When potters throw clay onto a stone, they make a connection across centuries to ancient workshops. The techniques and traditions of these early craftsmen, especially those of China&#x2019;s Sung dynasty, still inform many of the pottery practices in use today, thanks to the seminal work of Bernard Leach.<br><br> Leach&#x2019;s <i>A Potter&#x2019;s Book </i>was among the first to collect ancient workshop traditions for modern use in studios, emphasizing functional work. It became an immediate hit among potters who embraced its ideal of unity, spontaneity, and simplicity of form. Leach, considered the father of British studio pottery, went on to establish of one of the most respected studios in the world with the ideas of <i>A Potter&#x2019;s Book </i>at its foundation.<br><br> With this classic book, potters can learn everything, from how to set up their workshop to how to adapt pigment and glaze recipes to how to design custom kilns. It spotlights four types of pottery: Japanese raku, English slipware, stoneware, and oriental porcelain. Thanks to Leach&#x2019;s time in Japan and collaborations with master potter Shoji Hamada, it also serves as a fascinating look at the interplay between Eastern and Western art.</p><p><b>Bernard Howell Leach</b> (1887&#x2013;1979) was a British studio potter and art teacher. He was the founder of the Leach Pottery at St Ives in Cornwall and went on to teach some of the most celebrated ceramicists of the twentieth century.&#x201c;With his writings as well as with his ceramics, Leach played a major role in elevating the status of the European potter from craftsman to artist, thereby paving the way for the twentieth-century studio pottery movement.&#x201d; (<i>New York Times</i>)<br><br>"This updated edition of the classic by Leach (British potter and teacher) belongs on every ceramist&#x2019;s bookshelf. Minor text changes, a look at Leach&#x2019;s impact on the West, and numerous color photographs make this an even more valuable resource than the 1940 original. <br>Highly recommended." (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>"This fine new edition of <i>A Potter&#x2019;s Book</i>, first published in 1940, shows representative images of his work (and sometimes his son David&#x2019;s) alongside Japanese or Korean wares made from similar bodies or using similar glazes. It is always easy to spot the Leach." (<i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)</p><h2>A Voyage in the Clouds: The (Mostly) True Story of the First International Flight by Balloon in 1785</h2><p><p>In the year and a half since the flight of the first manned balloon in 1783, an Italian has flown, a Scot has flown, a woman has flown, even a sheep has flown. But no one has flown from one country to another. John Jeffries, an Englishman, and his pilot, Jean-Pierre Blanchard, a Frenchman, want to be the first. On January 7, 1785, they set out to cross the English Channel to France in a balloon. All seemed to be going fine, until Jeffries decides the balloon looks too fat and adjusts the air valve&#x2015;how hard could it be? Too bad he drops the wrench over the side of the aerial car. With no way to adjust the valve, the balloon begins to sink. Jeffries and Blanchard throw as much as they can overboard&#x2015;until there is nothing left, not even their clothes. Luckily, they come up with a clever (and surprising) solution that saves the day. A VOYAGE IN THE CLOUDS from Matthew Olshan and Sophie Blackall is a journey that will keep kids laughing the whole way.<br><b>A Margaret Ferguson Book</b></p></p><p><p><b>Matthew Olshan</b> is author of the critically acclaimed picture book <i>The Mighty Lalouche</i>, also illustrated by Sophie Blackall, as well as the adult novel <i>Marshlands</i>.

With humor that&#x2019;s never snarky, Olshan reminds readers that, sometimes, the challenge adventurers must overcome is not the elements; it&#x2019;s their own vanity.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly,</i> starred review</p><p>&#x201c;Blackall&#x2019;s witty illustrations&#x2015;which include full-page art and double-page spreads in color along with occasional black-and-white comic-panel strips; word balloons; and florid ornamentation&#x2015;feel plucked from the time period. An author&#x2019;s note directs readers to Dr. Jeffries&#x2019;s firsthand account of the flight and reveals that portions of the book rely on Olshan and Blackall&#x2019;s creative adaptation of factual events.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Horn Book, </i>starred review</p><p>&#x201c;The illustrations vary from traditional to graphic novel-style at points, using panels and dialogue balloons. Olshan establishes suspense as the two encounter problems and danger during their voyage, and children will want to keep reading and learning more about this historic trip.

Olshan tosses in some speculation to enliven a tale that really requires little additional embellishment, but those basic facts hold up. . .The muted colors and teardrop-shaped speech bubbles of the illustrations suggest eighteenth-century satirical cartoons, and they&#x2019;re as droll as Olshan&#x2019;s text, capturing the seriocomic perils that forced the squabbling frenemies to pull in harness together. No references are included, but an endnote on the facts and fictions herein is entertaining and useful, making this a delightful &#x2018;sequel&#x2019; to Hot Air (BCCB 7/05), Marjorie Priceman&#x2019;s &#x2018;(Mostly) True&#x2019; picture-book chronicle of the Montgolfiers&#x2019; flight in 1783.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Bulletin for the Center of Children's Books, </i>starred review</p><p>&#x201c;Rarely has a story of a historic first been so silly.

This Regency delight focuses on a dark duke with a sinful reputation and his determined efforts to seduce and ruin the innocent sister of his enemy&#x2014;only to fall victim himself to the gentle lady&#x2019;s good nature and passionate soul. <em>What I Did For a Duke </em>follows Long&#x2019;s delightful <em>I Kissed an Earl, </em>continuing the colorful feud between the Eversea and Redmond families, and it&#x2019;s one of the most scandalously entertaining love stories in many a season.</p><p><p>For years, he's been an object of fear, fascination . . . and fantasy.

Can they solve the ghost&#39;s mystery and get rid of Alex&#39;s awful rash before it ruins everything?</p><p>David Lubar created a sensation with his debut novel, HIDDEN TALENTS, an ALA Best Book for Young Adults. He is the author of over thirty-five books, for readers ranging from first grade through high school and beyond. These include PUNISHED! (A Junior Library Guild Selection), the Weenies short story collections, the popular middle-grade series Nathan Abercrombie: Accidental Zombie, and the Looniverse early chapter-book series. David lives in Pennsylvania with his wife and various felines.Gr 2&#x2013;4&#x2014;Though he has terrible allergies, Alex is excited to stay at his grandparents' new house with his cousin Sarah. But the two quickly discover that it's haunted by a ghost&#x2014;and Alex is horribly allergic to ghosts! Using Alex like a spectral Geiger counter, the cousins track down the ghost and offer to help him with a problem from his past. The author's trademark humor is less prevalent here than in his titles for older readers; this offering favors a simpler plot and word choice, befitting the chapter book audience. Lubar's ability to blend kid-friendly horror with goofy situations works wonderfully. Illustrations provide a nice break from the action, and the characters' big eyes and worried expressions often add to the silliness. The accessible vocabulary and short chapters make this ideal for kids starting to venture into independent reading. VERDICT A strong addition for elementary school libraries and a great way to infuse chapter book collections with a small dose of horror.&#x2014;Peter Blenski, Greenfield Public Library, WI</p><h2>The Thunder Keeper (A Wind River Reservation Mystery)</h2><p>The apparent suicide of a young Arapaho on sacred ground shocks the populace of the Wind River Reservation. But strange events following the death lead Vicky Holden and Father John O&#39;Malley to suspect foul play.</p><p>Margaret Coel is the <b>New York Times</b> bestselling, award-winning author of <b>The Thunder Keeper, The Spirit Woman, The Lost Bird, The Story Teller, The Dream Stalker, The Ghost Walker, The Eagle Catcher</b>, and several works of nonfiction. She has also authored many articles on the people and places of the American West. Her work has won national and regional awards. Her first John O'Malley mystery, <b>The Eagle Catcher</b>, was a national bestseller, garnering excellent reviews from the <b>Denver Post</b>, Tony Hillerman, Jean Hager, Loren D. Estleman, Stephen White, Earlene Fowler, Ann Ripley and other top writers in the field. A native of Colorado, she resides in Boulder.In her seventh mystery set among the Arapahos of Wyoming's Wind River Reservation featuring her twin sleuths, Father John O'Malley (on the rez) and Arapaho lawyer Vicky Holden (temporarily transplanted to Denver), Coel gets the atmosphere just right. Every physical detail of the "vision quest" that a desperate young man named Duncan Grover undertakes on a cliff above Bear Lake seems perfect, while the challenges of Vicky's new life as a high-profile attorney are equally sharp. But the actual story here is the problem: it seems to be made up of recycled plot elements from several other recent Western mysteries. Grover's murder, made to look like a suicide, and only uncovered when Father John hears the details in a confession; the heavy-breathing corporate villains seeking to exploit the Native Americans and plunder their riches (not oil or gold this time, but diamonds); the insensitive white cops who just don't get it surely we've covered this ground before. Too bad, because when Coel writes about Father John's tricky relationship with Vicky (echoed in a lawsuit filed by a frustrated woman against his new assistant), or Vicky's edgy moments with the husband and children she left behind, she is on original and interesting ground. The author's previous books have been justly praised by the likes of Tony Hillerman, but an overly familiar plot this time out could lead to bad word-of-mouth and a falling off in sales. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Secret Honor (Honor Bound)</h2><p><b>The crackling new novel in the bestselling Honor Bound series, by the master of the military thriller.<br></b><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As with his other enormously popular series, the first two novels in W. E .B. Griffin&#x2019;s saga of World War II espionage in Germany and Argentina &#x2013; <i>Honor Bound</i> and <i>Blood and Honor</i> &#x2013; became immediate bestsellers and were hailed as &#x201c;immensely entertaining adventures&#x201d; (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>). Now, in <i>Secret Honor</i>, Griffin creates his most rousing novel yet.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Wolf&#x2019;s Lair, a German general works toward the assassination of Adolf Hitler. In Buenos Aires, the general&#x2019;s son, code-named Galahad, falls under suspicion by the SS after a Nazi operation suddenly goes bad. In the middle of it all is OSS agent Cletus Frade, who knows the identity of father and son and what they will do next...if they can survive that long. For not only are SS and Abwehr officers hot on their trails in both countries, but the OSS has branded Frade a rogue agent and is determined to shake the truth from him, at whatever cost. If Frade can&#x2019;t figure a way to hold them all off, then the futures of all three men may be very short indeed....<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Written with the special flair that Griffin&#x2019;s readers expect, filled with high drama and real heroes, <i>Secret Honor</i> is further proof, in Tom Clancy&#x2019;s words, that &#x201c;Griffin is a storyteller in the grand tradition.&#x201d;</p><p>Don't be deceived by the blockbuster size of W.E.B. Griffin's third installment in the Honor Bound series. <i>Secret Honor</i> is an intricate book that reveals a remarkable attentiveness to historical detail and characterization. It is also a top-notch thriller set in Griffin's quasi-fictional version of WWII.<p> The plot is woven with so many threads, all of them worthwhile, that it actually feels more like a chronicle than a novel, but the central story takes up the continuing adventures of OSS agent Cletus Frade. Frade, a U.S. Marine whose father was almost the president of Argentina, was raised in Texas and now uses his father's special status in Argentine society to penetrate Nazi plans for South America. This time, however, Frade is not so much fighting the Nazis as supporting them. While one group, Himmler among them, is secretly stashing funds in Argentina to prepare for an escape when the Reich finally crumbles, a second group, including a German general and his son, are actually plotting to assassinate Hitler. Meanwhile, the OSS is on the verge of ex-communicating Frade, given his unwillingness to reveal the identity of the son, code-named "Galahad." </p><p> The details are what make this book: Cletus Frade is imprinted on the mind, clad in grease-stained khaki trousers, spouting Spanish-Texan four-letter epithets, and sporting cowboy boots as he repairs his father's ravaged old Horch touring sedan at Estancia San Pedro y San Pablo. Particularly engaging is Griffin's account of Argentine upper-strata social "politics," as Father Welner steers Cletus into his inevitable marriage. Reading <i>Secret Honor</i>, one enters many vividly drawn places--from Nazi secret meetings to Argentine estates--that bring this pivotal era to life. Finishing the book leaves one feeling a rare combination of sadness in leaving close colleagues behind and exhilaration at having witnessed history being made. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p><b>W. E.

In this ground-breaking biography, &nbsp;Austen is set on a wider stage than ever before, revealing a well-traveled and politically aware writer &#x2013; important aspects of her artistic development that have long been overlooked.</p><p><em>The Real Jane Austen </em>is a fresh, compelling, and surprising biography of the author of some of our most enduring classic books &#x2013; from <em>Pride and Prejudice </em>to <em>Sense and Sensibility, Emma </em>to <em>Persuasion</em> &#x2013; and a vivid evocation of the world that shaped her.</p></p><p><p>Acclaimed biographer Paula Byrne explores the forces that shaped the interior life of one of the most beloved novelists in the English language: her father's religious faith; her mother's aristocratic pedigree; her eldest brother's adoption; her relatives in the East and West Indies; the family's amateur theatricals; and her determination throughout her long struggle to become a published author. The woman who emerges is far tougher, more socially and politically aware, and altogether more modern than the conventional picture. Like a superb archaeologist, Byrne uses artifacts from Jane Austen's life to craft a vivid and more complex portrait of the writer than we have ever seen.</p><p>Paula Byrne is the critically acclaimed author of five biographies, including <em>Belle: The Slave Daughter and the Lord Chief Justice</em>, <em>The Real Jane Austen</em>, and <em>Mad World: Evelyn Waugh and the Secrets of Brideshead.</em> She lives in Oxford, England, with her husband, the academic and biographer Jonathan Bate.</p></p><h2>What Happens When People Die?</h2><p>To a little child, death is often a mysterious and frightening thing.

Most Americans have experienced temporary blackouts, and regard them as merely an inconvenience. Some Americans have experienced more protracted local and regional blackouts, as in the aftermaths of Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina, and may be better able to imagine the consequences of a nationwide blackout lasting months or years, that plunges the entire United States into the dark. In such a nightmare blackout, the entire population of the United States could be at risk. There would be no food. No water. Communications, transportation, industry, business and finance--all of the critical infrastructures that support modern civilization and the lives of the American people would be paralyzed by collapse of the electric power grid. Millions could die. How could a catastrophic blackout happen? Threats to the electric power grid are posed by cyber attack, sabotage, a geomagnetic super-storm, and electromagnetic pulse (EMP) from the high-altitude detonation of a nuclear weapon. Blackout Wars warns that terrorists and rogue states are developing a revolutionary new military strategy that could exploit all of these threats in combination, including exploiting the opportunity of severe weather or a geo-storm, to collapse the national electric grid and all the critical infrastructures. It would be the fall of American civilization. For the first time in history, the most dysfunctional societies, like North Korea that cannot even feed its own people, or even non-state actors like terrorists, could destroy the most successful societies on Earth--by means of a Blackout War. Attacking the electric grid enables an adversary to strike at the technological and societal Achilles Heel of U.S. military and economic power. Blackout Wars likens this new Revolution in Military Affairs to Nazi Germany&#39;s Blitzkrieg strategy, secretly developed and tested in low-profile experiments during the 1930s, sprung upon the Allies in 1939-1941 in a series of surprise attacks that nearly enabled the Third Reich to win World War II. Just as the West was asleep to the threat from the Blitzkrieg, so today U.S. and Western elites are blind to the looming threat from a Blackout War.</p><p>Dr. Peter Vincent Pry is Executive Director of the Task Force on National and Homeland Security, a Congressional Advisory Board dedicated to achieving protection of the United States from electromagnetic pulse (EMP), cyber attack, mass destruction terrorism and other threats to civilian critical infrastructures on an accelerated basis. Dr. Pry also is Director of the United States Nuclear Strategy Forum, an advisory board to Congress on policies to counter Weapons of Mass Destruction. Dr. Pry served on the staffs of the Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States (2008-2009); the Commission on the New Strategic Posture of the United States (2006-2008); and the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Attack (2001-2008). Dr. Pry served as Professional Staff on the House Armed Services Committee (HASC) of the U.S. Congress, with portfolios in nuclear strategy, WMD, Russia, China, NATO, the Middle East, Intelligence, and Terrorism (1995-2001). Dr. Pry was an Intelligence Officer with the Central Intelligence Agency responsible for analyzing Soviet and Russian nuclear strategy, operational plans, military doctrine, threat perceptions, and developing U.S. paradigms for strategic warning (1985-1995). He also served as a Verification Analyst at the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency responsible for assessing Soviet compliance with strategic and military arms control treaties (1984-1985).

The scene below resembled an area following a Category 5 hurricane or aerial bombardment. The many canal structures still remained at the whim of the elements, showing creeping signs of decay and neglect. The jungle was already beginning to reclaim the canal regions, commencing a long bid to erase any evidence that man had split the continents a century before. <br><br>Soulless figures walked about, searching, reacting to the firings <br><br>of dead synapses. <br><br>A corpse wearing only a mechanic&#x2019;s work shirt shuffled about the area. The mechanic had met its demise via the barrel of a Panamanian soldier&#x2019;s rifle, back when the national curfew was still being enforced. &#x201c;He&#x201d; became &#x201c;it&#x201d; shortly after the punctured heart stopped and the body temperature began to fall, letting loose the mystery that reanimated dead people. The anomaly (as it was known) spread quickly throughout the mechanic&#x2019;s nervous system, altering key areas of sensory anatomy. It anchored and replicated in the brain, but only in the sections where primal instinct developed and was stored via DNA and electrochemical switches from eons of evolution. Along its path of self-replication and infection, the anomaly made a quick stop inside the ear canal. There it microscopically altered the physical make-up of the inner ear ossicles, enhancing the hearing. The eyes were the last stop. After a few hours of reanimation, the anomaly completed replication and replacement of certain cellular structures inside the eye, resulting in rudimentary short-range thermal sensory ability, balancing its death-degraded vision. <br><br>The former mechanic stopped and cocked its head sideways. It could hear a noise in the distance, something familiar&#x2014;a nanosecond flash of audible recognition, then it was gone and forgotten. The sound grew louder, exciting the creature, causing salivation. Translucent gray fluid dribbled from its chin, hitting its bare and nearly skeletal leg. The mechanic took a small step forward in the direction of the noise; the open tendons on top of its foot flexed and pulled the small foot bones as it moved. The creature sensed that the increasing sound was not natural, was not the wind or incessant rain noises it normally ignored. The creature&#x2019;s pace quickened as it reached a small patch of dense jungle trees. A snake struck out as the mechanic entered the foliage, slapping dead flesh and leaving two small holes in its nearly gone calf muscle. The creature paid no attention and continued to slog forward, nearly clearing the foliage. The chorus of souls-be-damned boomed out from all directions as the thing broke through to the clearing. <br><br>Two hundred thousand undead on the mechanic&#x2019;s side of the Panama Canal bellowed at the sky. A gray military helicopter zoomed over at one hundred knots, trailing the canal southeast. <br><br>The mechanic reacted instinctively to the engine noise, reaching up as if it might pluck the great bird from the sky and eat it cold. Frenzied with hunger, it followed the whirlybird, eyes locked onto the flying machine. Ten paces later, the creature stepped over the edge into the canal waters. <br><br>The canal&#x2019;s twisting form was no longer filled with brown muddy water and transiting ships. Bloated, floating bodies now blocked her once-busy shipping route. Some of the disgusting forms still moved, not yet dissolved by the Panama heat and humidity or mosquito larva&#x2014;infested waters. The countless hordes on one side of the canal roared and moaned at their undead doppelg�ngers on the other in a Hatfield and McCoy feud spanning the great divide. <br><br>&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp; <br><br>Before the anomaly, the world was fixated on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, phony government U3 unemployment numbers, spot gold prices, currency indexes, and the worldwide debt crisis. The very few that now survived prayed to go back to a Dow 1,000 and 80 percent unemployment; at least it would be something. <br><br>The conditions on the ground had degraded exponentially since the first case of the anomaly was documented in China. Early in the crisis, the surviving executive branch of the United States government made the decision to nuke the major continental cities in a bid to &#x201c;deter, deny, or degrade the undead ability to eliminate the surviving population of the United States.&#x201d; The cities were leveled by high-order nuclear detonation. Many of the creatures were instantly disintegrated in the process but the tradeoff was catastrophic. The dead outside of the comparatively small blast zones were zapped with so many alpha, beta, and gamma particles that the radiation eradicated any bacteria that might enable decomposition, preserving the dead for what scientists estimated at decades. <br><br>A few scattered human survivors remained though, and some military command and control was still in place. An operation was at this very moment underway to uncover the chain of events that brought humanity to the brink, maybe beyond. <br><br>Behind closed doors there was talk of possibly engineering an effective weapon of mass destruction against the creatures, as there were not enough small-arms ammunition or people to pull the triggers left on the planet. Behind thicker closed doors, there was talk of other, more nefarious things. <br><br>&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp; <br><br>The helicopter pilot screamed back to the passengers, cheek full of chewing tobacco, &#x201c;Three-zero mikes until on top the USS Virginia!&#x201d; <br><br>The helicopter&#x2019;s internal communications system failed to function as advertised months ago. It was now only good for cockpit communications between the pilot and copilot up front. The pilot was easily in his sixties, as told by his gray hair, deep crow&#x2019;s feet, and old and battered Air America ball cap. The rider in the copilot&#x2019;s seat was not part of the air crew&#x2014;just another member of what was known on the flight docket as Task Force Hourglass. <br><br>Pilots had been in short supply over the past few months, most of them lost on reconnaissance missions. The remaining airworthy military aircraft were constructed of thousands of complex moving parts, all of which needed to be rigorously inspected and maintained, or they would soon become very expensive lawn darts. The old pilot seemed to enjoy the company of having someone in the right seat, someone to die alongside if things went too far south, which was frequent. <br><br>The rider appeared jumpy and hyperaware of his surroundings. Wearing an overly tight harness, his hand on the door latch and his eyes on the master caution panel, he nervously scanned the helicopter instruments. The rider risked a glance at the ground; they were flying low and fast. An optical illusion from the cockpit put the helicopter nearly level with the canal banks on either side. The creatures screamed and thrashed loudly as they fell into the water, unable to compete with the deafening engine noise. The rider easily but involuntarily filled the gaps with his imagination, hearing the songs of the dead from below. The permanent PTSD gained from the past year&#x2019;s events pushed forward in his consciousness. He instinctively slapped his side, feeling for his carbine, preparing for another crash. <br><br>The pilot took notice and squawked into his headset, &#x201c;Heard about what happened to you. Chopper went down in the badlands.&#x201d; <br><br>The rider keyed the microphone on his headset. &#x201c;Something like that.&#x201d; <br><br>The pilot grumbled, &#x201c;You just transmitted on the radio. Key down to talk to me, and up to talk to the world.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Oh, sorry.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about it; I doubt anyone heard it anyway. Only those things around. Lots of fellow pilots walking about down there now. These runs keep getting more dangerous by the sortie. The birds are falling apart, no spare parts . . . What did you do before?&#x201d; the old man yelled into the headset over the whine of the neglected turbine engines. <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a military officer.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;What branch?&#x201d; <br><br>The rider paused and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a navy lieu&#x2014;uh, a commander.&#x201d; <br><br>The pilot laughed as he said, &#x201c;Which is it, son? Lieutenant is a ways from commander.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Long, boring story.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Son, I doubt that. What did you do in the navy before?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Aviation.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Hell, you wanna fly the rest of the way?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;No thanks. I&#x2019;m not exactly the best helicopter stick.&#x201d; <br><br>The pilot chuckled at this. &#x201c;When I was running small fixed wings low over Laos before you were born, I didn&#x2019;t know how to fly one of these, either.&#x201d; <br><br>The rider looked down at the undead masses below and mumbled, &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t think we were flying anything over Laos.&#x201d; <br><br>The old man smiled and said, &#x201c;We weren&#x2019;t. But how do ya think all them Phoenix Program snipers got close and personal with the NVA brass? By humping their bolt guns a hundred miles through the jungle? Shit . . . if you think Phoenix was only active in Vietnam, I&#x2019;ve got some oceanfront property in Panama down there to sell ya!&#x201d; <br><br>Both men laughed over the loud thumping rhythm of the spinning rotor blades above their heads. The rider reached into his pack for a piece of gum scavenged from a military MRE, offering the pilot half. <br><br>&#x201c;No thanks, plays hell on my dentures and I&#x2019;m all out of Fixodent. Who you got back there with you anyway?&#x201d; <br><br>The rider frowned at the old man. &#x201c;They don&#x2019;t tell you anything, do they? The Arab-looking guy is a friend of mine. The others are SOCOM, or some of what&#x2019;s left of them anyway.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;SOCOM, hmm?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, a few frogs and such. I&#x2019;m not sure I can tell you much more than that and to be honest, I don&#x2019;t know much more anyway.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I understand, you wanna keep the old man in the dark.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s not that, it&#x2019;s . . .&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m kidding, no worries. I had to keep a secret or two in my day.&#x201d; <br><br>A few more rotor-thumping minutes passed before the pilot pointed his wrinkled finger forward to the horizon and said, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s the Pacific. The coords to the Virginia are on that kneeboard card. Mind punching them into the inertials?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Not a problem.&#x201d; <br><br>After the coordinates were entered, the pilot altered course a few degrees starboard and maintained heading. <br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name, son?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;My friend back there calls me Kilroy, Kil for short. What&#x2019;s yours?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Sam. Pleasure to meet you, even though this may be the first and last time.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Well, Sam, you sure know how to keep spirits high.&#x201d; <br><br>Sam reached up, tapped the glass on the upper gauge panel, and said, &#x201c;You know the risks, Kilroy. There ain&#x2019;t no tellin&#x2019; where you&#x2019;re goin&#x2019; in your little black submarine. Wherever it is, you can bet it will be just as dangerous as right below us.

Yet the ways in which we live sexuality and intimacy have been profoundly shaped by theories &#x2014; especially psychoanalytic ones, which have helped to place sexuality and desire at the center of the modern story about what a person is and how her history should be read. At the same time, other modes of explanation have been offered by popular and mass culture. In these domains, sexual desire is not deemed the core story of life; it is mixed up with romance, a particular version of the story of love.<p>In this small theoretical novella-cum-dictionary entry, Lauren Berlant engages love and desire in separate entries. In the first entry, Desire mainly describes the feeling one person has for something else: it is organized by psychoanalytic accounts of attachment, and tells briefly the history of their importance in critical theory and practice. The second entry, on Love, begins with an excursion into fantasy, moving away from the parent-child structure so central to psychoanalysis and looking instead at the centrality of context, environment, and history. The entry on Love describes some workings of romance across personal life and commodity culture, the place where subjects start to think about fantasy on behalf of their actual lives.</p><p>Whether viewed psychoanalytically, institutionally, or ideologically, love is deemed always an outcome of fantasy. Without fantasy, there would be no love. Desire/Love takes us on a tour of all of the things that sentence might mean.</p></p><p>Lauren Berlant is George M.

We know rest and reflection are necessary for a healthy life&#x2015;even Jesus took time to get away from the crowds, away from the demands of everyday life, to pray, to spend time with close friends, to sleep. But when Carolyn Weber&#x2015;emotionally and physically exhausted from managing her career as a college professor, writing her first book and parenting three children under the age of three&#x2015;hears this truth from a friend, all she can think is: but who will do everything if I don't? And this sets her on a journey to find the still, small space in each day. In these pages Carolyn reflects on the eternal beauty that lurks within the present. Drawing from literature, history and everyday life, <em>Holy Is the Day</em> is a collection of spiritual reflections that trace the way God's ever-renewing grace is a gift of the present. Opening it we find poignant stories of endurance, humility, compassion, remembrance and gratitude, as well a harrowing account of near-death experience. Carolyn gives us new eyes to receive the precious gift of the present and give it away to others.</p><p>Carolyn Weber is an author, speaker and teacher. Her recent academic positions include associate professor of English literature at Seattle University and visiting associate professor of English literature at Westmont College, Santa Barbara, California. She is also the author of <em>Surprised by Oxford</em> (Thomas Nelson), a memoir about her doctoral studies at Oxford."This book's first chapter, about the unexpectedly complicated birth of a child, is breath-stopping and reveals Carolyn Weber as a writer of unusual skill. Her abilities with the English language match the intensity of the event she describes. . . . The book's admirable theme is keeping your heart fixed on God and finding signs of God in the hard times." (Preston Jones, Faith Today, March/April 2014)<br><br>"Oh my, what an amazing book, one of the very best books we've read all year, elegant, interesting, full of fascinating episodes of a fascinating life as a writer, mother, teacher. You may know Ms Weber from her highly regarded conversion memoir <em>Surprised by Oxford</em> and now you should know her for this fabulous book of wise Christian instruction, guidance for finding God in the ordinary, and how to embrace a busy life with grace and a sense of God's daily presence. Oh, the writing in this--what a joy to read! This is a wise and good book, certainly worthy of the highest praise: a Hearts Minds Best Book of 2013 award." (Byron Borger, Hearts Minds Bookstore "Booknotes" Blog, January 21, 2014)<br><br>"Sometimes it seems like life has a way of combining a series of events that leave a person wanting to simply make it through each day. Carolyn Weber knows about such times, and in <em>Holy Is the Day</em> she masterfully shares her personal struggles with the insightful lessons she learned in moving forward from the past and experiencing God in the present. Weber encourages believers to see God at work every day in every situation." (Jeff Friend, Worship Leader, November/December 2013)<br><br>"This book is a beautiful blend of everyday musings and discovering the joy of living in the moment, enjoying the gift of today." (Miriam Leslie, Living Light News, November/December 2013)<br><br>"Weber's insights are deeply thoughtful and beautifully articulated. Suggest this title especially to fans of her book, <em>Surprised By Oxford</em>, and to English majors, who will appreciate the frequent references to authors, poets, and characters from the literary past and present." (Christy Pitney, CBA Retailers + Resources, October 2013)<br><br>"<em>Holy Is the Day</em> grabbed my attention and held it with lines like, 'I couldn't afford therapy, so I started writing.' I love everything about Carolyn Weber's writing. The frankness with which she invites us to share her complicated life as a wife, mother, academic, driven career woman, damaged child, daughter of aging parents, beleaguered believer. The surprises as she leads us through the bends and twists in her spiritual journey. The fresh insights she brings to scriptural truths, from the perspective of someone who unexpectedly came to faith in Christ. And the marvelous turns of phrase from someone who loves literature and learning. My copy of <em>Holy Is the Day</em> is dog-eared and underlined; yours will be too." (Wendy Elaine Nelles, cofounder of The Word Guild and coeditor of Hot Apple Cider)<br><br>"Weber's memoir is a delight to read, perhaps best summed up in her wise pronouncement at the center of the book that 'trauma prepares us for resurrection.' She writes of having babies at an 'advanced maternal age,' pursuing an academic career in a decidedly anti-Christian professional environment, trying to figure out how to juggle teaching with writing and family, and other day-to-day traumas of life, large and small. She rises up refreshed from each struggle and serves up what she learns with thought-provoking excursions into Scripture as well as into the literature she loves. She writes sweetly and earnestly, like a wise child. Or perhaps like the wise old woman of God that she hopes someday to become which, I'd argue, she already is." (Patty Kirk, writer in residence and associate professor of English at John Brown University, author of The Easy Burden of Pleasing God)<br><br>"I could not put <em>Holy Is the Day</em> down! Right from her opening story, Weber hooks us with her luscious use of language and reels us close with her insights and stories, all keenly crafted to help open our eyes to see God at work and present in our days. A beautiful read." (Caryn Rivadeneira, author of Broke and Grumble Hallelujah)<br><br>"Carolyn Weber lives gracefully and writes elegantly. Her poetic eyes search beneath the surface, unearthing delightful insights missed by those in a hurry. <em>Holy Is the Day</em> is a call to see God and latch onto him, so he takes us through the day as he envisions it. This is a beautiful book that spoke to my heart and changed my day." (Randy Alcorn, author of If God Is Good and Deception)<br><br>"Life and death, sorrow and joy. Waves of life that roll into Carolyn Weber's life are beautifully, soulfully examined. The author's story is meditatively interwoven with Scripture's story, not to hand us answers, but to offer us hope. The book is lovingly and honestly crafted. Read this one carefully as it is a gift from a heart that has grown in wisdom."

Fans of Winchester's <em>Krakatoa, The Man Who Loved China</em>, and <em>The Professor and the Madman</em> will love this masterful, penetrating, and resonant tale of humanity finding its way across the ocean of history.</p></p><p><b>Product Description</b><br> Blending history and anecdote, geography and reminiscence, science and exposition, the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Krakatoa</i> tells the breathtaking saga of the magnificent Atlantic Ocean, setting it against the backdrop of mankind's intellectual evolution. <p></p> <p>Until a thousand years ago, no humans ventured into the Atlantic or imagined traversing its vast infinity. But once the first daring mariners successfully navigated to far shores&#x2014;whether it was the Vikings, the Irish, the Chinese, Christopher Columbus in the north, or the Portuguese and the Spanish in the south&#x2014;the Atlantic evolved in the world's growing consciousness of itself as an enclosed body of water bounded by the Americas to the West, and by Europe and Africa to the East. <i>Atlantic</i> is a biography of this immense space, of a sea which has defined and determined so much about the lives of the millions who live beside or near its tens of thousands of miles of coast.</p> The Atlantic has been central to the ambitions of explorers, scientists and warriors, and it continues to affect our character, attitudes, and dreams. Poets to potentates, seers to sailors, fishermen to foresters&#x2014;all have a relationship with this great body of blue-green sea and regard her as friend or foe, adversary or ally, depending on circumstance or fortune. Simon Winchester chronicles that relationship, making the Atlantic come vividly alive. Spanning from the earth's geological origins to the age of exploration, World War II battles to modern pollution, his narrative is epic and awe-inspiring. <p></p><p></p> <strong> A Q&amp;A with Author Simon Winchester </strong><br><strong> </strong> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Writing a &#x201c;biography&#x201d; of a massive subject like the Atlantic Ocean is audacious and seemingly daunting. What inspired you to write the book, how long did it take you, and what did your research entail?</p> <p><strong>Winchester:</strong> It occurred to me one afternoon while, for the umpteenth time, I was crossing &#x2018;the pond&#x2019; on a flight between London and New York, that we took the waters below us far too much for granted. I thought back to the first crossing I had ever made, back in 1963, on a ship&#x2014;and the romance of the ocean as I saw it then&#x2014;and I decided that it could be very interesting to look into the role the Atlantic has played in humankind&#x2019;s history. I spent the next eighteen months travelling, going everywhere from the Faroes and Iceland in the north, to Tristan da Cunha and Patagonia in the south. The book itself took eight months to write, four to edit.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What was the most unusual or fascinating fact you discovered while researching and writing <i>Atlantic</i>? </p> <p><strong>Winchester:</strong> I remain intrigued by the thought that the State of Israel was in effect born as a result of a lack of cordite in the Royal Navy&#x2019;s ammunition stores during the Battle of the Atlantic in 1916. A White Russian biologist, Chaim Weizmann, at the time a professor at the University of Manchester, worked out how to solve this problem, and when the British government of the time offered to reward him for his game-changing invention, he declined&#x2014;asking only for Arthur Balfour to make his famous Declaration of 1917, which led to the formation of Israel.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why is the Atlantic significant in the development of Western civilization? Is there one important thing about the ocean we should know but do not?</p> <p><strong>Winchester:</strong> The first true parliamentary democracy was founded in the Atlantic, in Iceland in the tenth century&#x2014;and the concept spread rapidly through northern Europe. It was then followed in short order by the establishment of a similarly organized network of traders and trade routes, the so-called Hanseatic leaguers. That two such crucial aspects of modern human civilization&#x2014;government and trade&#x2014;are based still today on principles laid down beside the Atlantic Ocean is a fact little remembered by most &#x2014;and when I found the story out, it astonished and delighted me.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> You are a sailor yourself. Have you sailed the Atlantic? What was the experience like? </p> <p><strong>Winchester:</strong> I have sailed the entire Indian Ocean; and I have sailed a little in the South Atlantic&#x2014;undertaking the voyage in a tiny (30ft) steel gaff-rigged schooner. But while I had few major problems sailing between the coasts of India and South Africa, once I had &#x2018;rounded the bend&#x2019;, as it were, and passed into the Atlantic, everything changed: the sea became very rough and (a particular problem in a steel yacht) very cold. And so I abandoned the Atlantic attempt&#x2014;a decision that gives me ever greater respect today for the ocean itself, and for those sailors who are brave and determined enough to sail it. (In my defense&#x2014;since 16 year olds now make the journey&#x2014;I should point out that I went out without radio or radar, and with only a sextant as a navigation aid. GPS and e-mail make modern yachting a somewhat less arduous business. But the inescapable fact that I wiped out troubles me still. A bit.)</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> How do today&#x2019;s giant cruise ships compare to their predecessors like the Queen Mary or the Titanic? Have we lost something fundamental in how we experience the ocean with modernization?</p> <p><strong>Winchester:</strong> I detest the big cruise ships of today, immense Vegas style monstrosities filled with amusements specifically designed&#x2014;or so it seems&#x2014;utterly to detach the passenger from the realities of the ocean he is crossing (and to make even more money for the shipowners, of course). One surely goes to sea to experience the sea, it seems to me&#x2014;and if you are in a gigantic floating play-center, and one that barely moves with the waves, then why not just stay home, and in doing so burn less fuel and pollute the world a little less?</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Is it possible for 21st century humans to regain a sense of awe and respect for this magnificent natural wonder? What might it take for us to do so? </p> <p><strong>Winchester:</strong> It is my fond hope that just a few good people who may read and like this book will stop for a moment, and perhaps then begin to think about and regard the ocean in a different way. And then maybe go down to the shore and look at it, and consider some of its wonders. And then, most importantly, tell the next generation that this body of water, like all the great oceanic bodies of water on the planet, is a rare and precious entity deserving of our care and our respect. I realize this may be no more than wishful thinking: but after writing this book I have come to feel a very powerful connection with the Atlantic Ocean, and I so very much want others to look at it in the same way.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> How does the Atlantic compare to other oceans? What makes it special/unique?</p> <p><strong>Winchester:</strong> Of the world&#x2019;s great oceans the Atlantic is not the biggest; it is not the prettiest; it is not the most benign. But it does possess the greatest concentration of the marker-events of human history. And if, as seems unarguable, the Mediterranean could once fairly be said to have been the inland sea of classical civilization, then surely the Atlantic Ocean, by virtue of this huge concentration of ideas, events, inventions and developments, has become, and unarguably also, the inland sea of modern civilization. No other ocean comes close to filling this role &#x2013; which is why the Atlantic rises, head and shoulders, above all of its taller, prettier and calmer maritime cousins.</p> <p></p><p></p><p><em>Atlantic</em> is a biography of a tremendous space that has been central to the ambitions of explorers, scientists, and warriors, and continues profoundly to affect our character, attitudes, and dreams. Simon Winchester makes the Atlantic come vividly alive. Spanning the ocean&#x2019;s story from its geological origins to the age of exploration&#x2014;covering the Vikings, the Irish, the Basques, John Cabot, and Christopher Columbus in the north, and the Portuguese and the Spanish in the south&#x2014;and from World War II battles to today&#x2019;s struggles with pollution and overfishing, his narrative is epic, intimate, and awe inspiring. More than a mere history, this is an unforgettable journey of unprecedented scope by one of the most gifted writers in the English language.</p></p><h2>Clinical Applications of Pathophysiology: An Evidence-Based Approach</h2><p>This practice-focused review guide and workbook covers 27 of the most commonly encountered health problems to outline the connections between pathophysiology, assessment, diagnosis, and management, with an emphasis on the clinical use of pathophysiologic concepts.

Pass� notions that once defined drawing as being a preparatory stage for painting or sculpture have long since been cast aside. Drawing is now fully recognized as its own art form&#x2014;in the biennials, art fairs, museum exhibitions, and beyond. Drawing has come of age.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Contemporary artists are increasingly discovering that drawing is something unique and different from painting. It is an intense, sensitive, compelling, personal, and utterly direct art form, one with its own concepts, characteristics, and techniques. In addition, contemporary drawing is not governed by any particular imagery, but rather encompasses a variety of approaches, including realist, abstract, modernist, and post-modernist.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Contemporary Drawing delves into the essential and far-reaching concepts of this medium, exploring surface, mark, space, composition, scale, materials, and intentionality in turn. Key techniques, such as using nature to induce marks and working with a checklist to determine a drawing&#x2019;s problems, are introduced throughout. Plus, an in-depth chapter examines a number of artists, such as William Kentridge and Gego, who are breaking traditional boundaries that separate one artistic discipline from another.<br><br>Lushly illustrated by a wide range of highly accomplished contemporary artists, Contemporary Drawing offers a broad perspective on this expansive and energized field of art.</p><p>Margaret Davidson has a BFA from the University of Michigan and a MFA from the University of Washington. She is represented by Anchor Art Space in Anacortes, Washington. Davidson currently teaches courses in Beginning Drawing, Drawing from Modern Masters, the Aesthetics of Drawing, and various drawing technique classes at Gage Academy of Art in Seattle, Washington.Drawings are, in truth, flat things. Whether they are on paper or cloth or walls or floors, they are actually flat. Furthermore, even when the surface is a three-dimensional thing, a drawn image that is wrapped around it is made emphatically flat, by sheer contrast. Some contemporary drawing artists explore this flatness. To do so requires attention to the mark on the surface, and a constant awareness of the mark&#39;s relationship to the space implicit on the page. This is no easy thing, but the results, when this is carried out well, can be both austere and luminous. To focus on the mark and its realtionship to the surface and the space is something akin to meditation and focusing on one&#39;s own breathing. Both are so fundamental, so easily taken for granted, that it is difficult to sustain any amount of thoguht just for them. However, in drawing, when this is achieved, once the eye and hand have been successfully focused, the mind is free to open to a new sense of space and time.</p><h2>Journey: Based on the True Story of OR7, the Most Famous Wolf in the West</h2><p>This beautiful picture book&nbsp;follows the journey of a young gray wolf who garnered nationwide attention when he&nbsp;became the first wild wolf in California in almost a century.

But in spite of the rumors about his company's substandard care, this death appears to be a case of malice, not of malpractice&#x2014;especially after Markham's entire family is gunned down in their home.<p>Lt. Abe Glitsky has strong suspicions about a doctor with opportunity, means, and motives to spare. But working up a case against Eric Kensing might not be easy, especially when Glitsky has to rely on two bumbling rookies to gather the evidence. When defense attorney Dismas Hardy takes Kensing on as a client, both Glitsky and Hardy have to worry not only about losing the case, but about losing a best friend as well. And as the investigation leads to something bigger than they expected, they may both be in danger of losing their lives as well. . .</p></p><p>Bad medicine makes good plotting in John Lescroart's latest, which brings back lawyer Dismas Hardy and his best friend, homicide cop Abe Glitsky. A string of suspicious deaths at a San Francisco HMO don't look like murder at first--until Tim Markham, the head of the HMO, dies from injuries received in a hit-and-run accident. But did the injuries really kill him? Glitsky believes that Hardy's client, Dr. Eric Kensing, killed his boss. Kensing had at least two good reasons: not only was Markham having an affair with his wife, but his cost- cutting restrictions were threatening the lives of Kensing's patients. Kensing is a bit too heroic for the reader to ever believe in him as a suspect, and the real murderer is pretty obvious from the get-go, which cuts down the suspense. Still, the reappearance of Glitsky and Hardy will be welcomed by Lescroart's many fans, who'll be delighted with the widowed cop's new wife and new life and happy to see the guys back in familiar if well-trodden territory. <i>--Jane Adams</i>John Lescroart is the author of nineteen previous novels, including <i>The Betrayal, The Suspect, The Hunt Club, The Motive, The Second Chair, The First Law, The Oath, The Hearing</i>, and <i>Nothing But the Truth</i>.

Butterworth and Thomas L. Pangle. The three parts of the book, "Attainment of Happiness," "Philosophy of Plato," and "Philosophy of Aristotle," provide a philosophical foundation for Alfarabi's political works.</p></p><p><p>Muhsin Mahdi is James Richard Jewett Professor of Arabic, Emeritus, in the Harvard University Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilization. Charles E. Butterworth is Professor of Government and Politics at the University of Maryland. Thomas L. Pangle is the Joe R. Long Chair in Democratic Studies at the University of Texas at Austin.</p>"Alfarabi is now considered to be the founder of Muslim philosophy, and proves to be not simply the bridge for carrying over the thought of Aristotle and Plato into Western thought but a man of great originality. . . . Muhsin Mahdi makes clear that Alfarabi is not a popularizer but a man of great subtlety of thought and one who discerns the significance of Plato unmixed with Neo-Platonic philosophy."&#x2015;Choice<br><br>"Alfarabi's Philosophy of Plato and Aristotle will be of incomparable value to those who are interested in the way in which the major ideas of Plato and Aristotle had been accepted, understood, and developed by the Muslim thinkers within the confines of the Islamic cultural milieu before these great philosophical ideas were introduced into the mainstream of scholastic philosophy in the West."&#x2015;Philosophy East and West</p><h2>Inner Christianity: A Guide to the Esoteric Tradition</h2><p><i>Inner Christianity </i> is the first introduction to mystical and esoteric Christianity for the general reader. It speaks from a nonsectarian point of view, unearthing insights from the whole of the Christian tradition, orthodox and heretical, famous and obscure. The esoteric tradition has traditionally searched for meanings that would yield a deeper inner knowledge of the divine. While traditional Christianity draws a timeline from Adam's Fall to the Day of Judgment, the esoteric often sees time as folding in on itself, bringing every point to the here and now. While the Church fought bitterly over dogma, the esoteric borrowed freely from other traditions&#x2014;Kabbalah, astrology, and alchemy&#x2014;in their search for metaphors of inner truth. <br><br>Rather than basing his book around exponents of esoteric doctrine, scholar Richard Smoley concentrates on the questions that are of interest to every searching Christian. How can one attain direct spiritual experience? What does "the Fall" really tell us about coming to terms with the world we live in? Can we find salvation in everyday life? How can we ascend, spiritually, through the various levels of existence? What was Christ's true message to humankind? From the Gospel of Thomas to <i>A Course in Miracles, </i> from the Jesus Prayer to alchemy and Tarot, from Origen to Dante to Jung, Richard Smoley sheds the light of an alternative Christianity on these issues and more.</p><p>Richard Smoley is a graduate of Harvard College and Oxford University. He is the coauthor, with Jay Kinney, of <i>Hidden Wisdom: A Guide to the Western Inner Traditions </i> and the former editor of <i>Gnosis</i> magazine."A wide range of material . . . provides a solid introduction to esoteric Christianity."&#x2014; <i>Library Journal</i> <br><br>"Smoley traverses a vast continent of belief and practice in this lively guide to Christian esotericism, and he does so with great intelligence and style."&#x2014;Philip Zaleski, editor of the Best Spiritual Writing series <br><br>"We overlook the very heart and soul of Christianity when we reduce it to rules, dogmas, and rigid moral directives. <i>Inner Christianity </i> helps correct that mistake by spelling out, clearly and thoughtfully, the subtle interior mysteries of this religion. This book could help many, Christians and others, find a new level of intelligence in Christian thought and practice. It could change the direction of your spiritual life."&#x2014;Thomas Moore, author of <i>Care of the Soul </i> and <i>The Soul's Religion </i> <br><br>"In this deeply wise and important work, Richard Smoley restores the realm of inner space to the Christian tradition. Drawing upon a wide range of mystical and esoteric literature and practice, he shows how multidimensional is the Christian message, and how profound its understanding of the nature and purpose of the psyche. In a time of so much change and confusion, this potent book serves as a source of profound guidance and gnosis."&#x2014;Jean Houston, Ph.D., author of <i>A Mythic Life </i> and <i>Jump Time </i> <br><br>"Richard Smoley has rolled away the rock of symbol, myth, metaphor, and obscuration and resurrected the radiant light of an inner Christianity. In clear and vibrant language, he makes the deepest wisdom of the Christian tradition available and accessible to everyone. This book is an empowerment of faith and spirit and will, I predict, become a classic for all who walk the path of Christ in the midst of their everyday lives."&#x2014;David Spangler, author of <i>Everyday Miracles, Blessing: The Art and the Practice, </i>and <i>Apprenticed to Spirit </i></p><h2>The Warlord of Mars</h2><p>Far to the north, in the frozen wastes of Polar Mars, lay the home of the Holy Therns, sacred and inviolate.

Here, Earthman John Carter, swept by magical means to the Red Planet, embarks on a rescue mission to the frozen polar wastes to save his beloved Martian princess, Dejah Thoris.</p></p><h2>My Silent War: The Autobiography of a Spy</h2><p>In the annals of espionage, one name towers above all others: that of H.A.R. &#x201c;Kim&#x201d; Philby, the ringleader of the legendary Cambridge spies. A member of the British establishment, Philby joined the Secret Intelligence Service in 1940, rose to the head of Soviet counterintelligence, and, as MI6&#x2019;s liaison with the CIA and the FBI, betrayed every secret of Allied operations to the Russians, fatally compromising covert actions to roll back the Iron Curtain in the early years of the Cold War.<br><br>Written from Moscow in 1967, <i>My Silent War</i> shook the world and introduced a new archetype in fiction: the unrepentant spy. It inspired John le Carr�&#x2019;s Smiley novels and the later espionage novels of Graham Greene. Kim Philby was history&#x2019;s most successful spy. He was also an exceptional writer who gave us the great iconic story of the Cold War and revolutionized, in the process, the art of espionage writing.</p><p>&#x201c;Far more gripping than any novel of espionage I can remember.&#x201d; &#x2014;Graham Greene<br><br>&#x201c;To this day I am convinced that he was not an ideologue.

The conspirators have intimate and exclusive knowledge of this momentous second coming&#x2014;but they insist on keeping it to themselves. <br><br>What could be the purpose of such a conspiracy? Why are the conspirators so desperate to keep their information a secret? And what does it mean for mankind?<br><br>In this riveting, well-researched book, Picknett and Price offer compelling evidence that the conspiracy exists&#x2014;and expose the insidious motivations of the individuals and organizations behind it....</p><p><b>Lynn Picknett</b> and <b>Clive Prince</b> are writers, researchers and lecturers on the paranormal, the occult, and historical and religious mysteries.Strange though it may seem, this is not the book we originally set out to write. In a sense, we are very surprised<b> </b>and not a little shaken<b> </b>to have found ourselves on the rock-strewn path that led, ultimately, to <b>The Stargate Conspiracy</b>.<p>We had intended to write a follow-up to our 1997 book <b>The Templar Revelation</b>, which argued that Christianity was essentially an offshoot of the ancient Egyptian religion of Isis and Osiris<b> </b>meaning that our culture is not <b>Judeo</b>-Christian at all, but <b>Egypto</b>-Christian. The implications were astonishingly far-reaching, but we also disclosed the most carefully hidden of all the secrets of the heretical Knights Templar in the most controversial revelation of the book<b> </b>namely, that they believed that John the Baptist was the true Messiah, and that Jesus was, to say the very least, his usurper.</p><p>Wanting to learn more about our civilization&#x2019;s Egyptian roots, we researched further into the ancient religion, and found ourselves examining the Pyramid Texts and the origin of Hermetic writings. The more we progressed, the more we realized the ancient Egyptians possessed astonishing knowledge, far beyond that generally accepted by modern academics. We discovered that those far-off people had an understanding of cosmology unequalled until our own century, and even now perhaps they still have something to teach us. But in the end even the largely unknown and unacknowledged genius of the ancient Egyptians was not to be the subject of the book.</p><p>As non-academics researching ancient Egypt we could not remain unaware of the upsurge of interest in the &#x2018;alternative Egypt&#x2019; of Andrew Collins, Colin Wilson and others, whose books challenge the often rather complacent &#x2018;certainties&#x2019; of mainstream Egyptology. Above all three authors have become associated in the public mind with radical new ideas about ancient cultures, particularly Egypt: Robert Temple, author of the seminal <b>The Sirius Mystery</b> (1976); Robert Bauval, co-author with Adrian Gilbert of <b>The Orion Mystery</b> (1994); and Graham Hancock, whose runaway success was established with <b>The Sign and the Seal</b> (1992). Since then Hancock has gone on to entrance huge audiences worldwide with <b>Fingerprints of the Gods</b> (1995) and, with his wife Santha Faiia, <b>Heaven&#x2019;s Mirror</b> (1998), and also collaborating with Robert Bauval to produce <b>Keeper of Genesis</b> (1996) and (together with John Grigsby) <b>The Mars Mystery</b> (1998). These books encompass a vast range of fascinating and radical new ideas, many of which have now become so entrenched among their readers as to be accepted as hard fact. And, like most of their readers, we, too, began as enthralled admirers.</p><p>After many months of researching and writing this book, we still admired those authors&#x2019; energy and commitment, but as we stood back from their work, we have perceived a new and considerably larger pattern taking shape. Whether or not those authors are aware of it, their work forms an intrinsic part of what amounts to an orchestrated campaign.</p><p>And the matter does not end there. The bitter controversy surrounding the idea of a long-dead civilization on Mars has also been absorbed into this campaign and<b> </b>like the mysteries of Egypt<b> </b>has been pressed into service to present a carefully stage-managed message. Essentially, it proposes that the ancient gods were extraterrestrials<b> and they&#x2019;re back</b>. But the subtext is very clever: only certain, chosen people hear their words, and only certain chosen people will be part of the revelations to come. We can hazard a guess at the identity of some of the chosen, but the others may be rather surprising.</p><p>This is the well-worn tactic of &#x2018;divide and rule,&#x2019; and has worrying, quasi-religious overtones. And it is no obscure and tiny cult, but a massive phenomenon that, in one shape or form, has infiltrated much of the West&#x2019;s cultural and spiritual life. But who lies behind it? And what on earth would anyone hope to gain by it?</p><p>We certainly considered the idea that we may have developed into sad cases of paranoia<b> </b>the thought was to recur several times as we plunged deeper into this investigation<b> </b>but the evidence remains, staring us all in the face, and there is no doubt in our minds that a huge conspiracy is trying to make us think in certain ways. And for such a global plot to work, it requires teams of fellow conspirators, whose participation may be unwitting or otherwise. These groups, we were to find, not only included, rather predictably perhaps, intelligence agencies such as the CIA and MI5, but also less obvious candidates, from New Age gurus to cutting-edge physicists, top-level scientists and multimillionaires.</p><p>Cynically exploiting our <b>fin de si�cle</b> hunger for signs and wonders, and our ongoing love affair with the mysteries of ancient Egypt, the conspirators are in the process of creating a massive, insidious belief system that feeds on millennium fever, though perhaps not blossoming properly until the first years of the twenty-first century.</p><p>The fact that modern man&#x2019;s craving for contact with the numinous and the ineffable is being cynically exploited on a vast scale does not mean that there are never genuine paranormal phenomena or mystical experiences. Nor do we suggest that there are no mysteries about man&#x2019;s ancient past or his place in the universe. While we are critical of certain beliefs and claims to have solved some of those mysteries, it is because we find fault with them, not because we have a &#x2018;skeptical&#x2019; bias. What disturbs us greatly is the use to which many otherwise innocent or uplifting beliefs and concepts are being put.</p><p>Even the lives of those with no interest in such subjects will inevitably be touched my this campaign to have us believe and be persuaded to think in a certain way. We came to realize, with heavy hearts, that part of this plot is to prepare us to accept certain ideas that we would normally find unacceptable, perhaps even repugnant. Make no mistake, this amounts to cultural and spiritual brainwashing on a lavish scale.</p><p>This story is so challenging that we can only ask for a willing suspension of disbelief, and for our readers to follow our detective work step by step, abandoning preconceptions and personal biases along the way. At the end, perhaps the thought might be allowed: what <b>if</b> this book is right? What <b>if</b> there really is a &#x2018;stargate conspiracy&#x2019; eating away at the heart of democracy, human autonomy and decency itself? What <b>if</b> we are being prepared for the acceptance of something that we would normally find, to say the least, disturbing?</p><p>This book is not an attempt to rally the masses or create some kind of political backlash against the conspiracy. Perhaps, in any case, those with vested interests would ensure that such an attempt would be doomed to ignominious<b> </b>and immediate<b> </b>failure.

The definition of new media is broad&#x2014;from radio to smart phones&#x2014;and the analysis of their impact is honest and straightforward. His meticulous diagnosis of their effects concludes with a discussion of the ways individuals might limit and counteract the most deleterious effects of this new epidemic.</p><p><b>Jean-Claude Larchet</b> holds a PhD from the University of Strasbourg, and is the author of Therapy of Spiritual Illness. Andrew A. Torrance graduated from the University of Cambridge in 1968 and obtained a PhD in 1971 from Imperial College, London. He joined the teaching staff at Trinity College, Dublin, in 1980.</p><h2>The Trotula: An English Translation of the Medieval Compendium of Women&#39;s Medicine (The Middle Ages Series)</h2><p><p><i>The Trotula</i> was the most influential compendium of women's medicine in medieval Europe. Scholarly debate has long focused on the traditional attribution of the work to the mysterious Trotula, said to have been the first female professor of medicine in eleventh- or twelfth-century Salerno, just south of Naples, then the leading center of medical learning in Europe. Yet as Monica H. Green reveals in her introduction to the first English translation ever based upon a medieval form of the text, the Trotula is not a single treatise but an ensemble of three independent works, each by a different author. To varying degrees, these three works reflect the synthesis of indigenous practices of southern Italians with the new theories, practices, and medicinal substances coming out of the Arabic world.</p><p>Green here presents a complete English translation of the so-called standardized Trotula ensemble, a composite form of the texts that was produced in the midthirteenth century and circulated widely in learned circles. The work is now accessible to a broad audience of readers interested in medieval history, women's studies, and premodern systems of medical thought and practice.</p></p><p>Monica H. Green is Professor of History at Arizona State University. Her dual-language critical edition of the Trotula is also available from the University of Pennsylvania Press.<p>"This long-awaited book makes available an English translation of a set of texts which represents the most important collection of material on women's diseases and their treatments for the period from the twelfth to the fifteenth centuries."&#x2014;<i>Social History of Medicine</i></p><br><br><p>"<i>The Trotula: A Medieval Compendium of Women's Medicine</i> furnishes students and scholars with an invaluable reference. Backed by more than twenty years of scrupulous research and publication, as well as an insightful methodology, it also provides them with an object of inspiration. Green's work is a remarkable example of scholarship."&#x2014;<i>Comitatus</i></p><br><br><p>"Thanks to Monica H. Green's splendid new critical edition and translation . . . one of the toughest nuts of medieval medical learning has been cracked. . . . The introduction and translation are spirited and readable; both could be profitably assigned to undergraduates and would provide an excellent entry not only into medieval women's medicine but also into the rich worlds of medical practice and textual transmission."&#x2014;<i>Speculum</i></p></p><h2>Through the Flames (Left Behind: The Kids #3)</h2><p>This series is based on the best-selling adult Left Behind series. Readers will see the Rapture and Tribulation through the eyes of four kids who have been left behind.</p><p>Starting just a few days after Jesus Christ snatched the faithful to heaven in <i>The Vanishings</i> (the first book in the Left Behind: The Kids series), <i>Through the Flames</i> opens with our four teen heroes shacked up in Judd's abandoned house. Judd, Vicki, and Lionel are still trying to convince Ryan that he should accept Christ if he knows what's good for him--Judd even makes Ryan go to church and Bible study as a condition of living with them. ("As long as you live under my roof, you follow my rules....") But even bigger problems are brewing. The four must stay on the lookout for the Antichrist, whom their Bible mentor Bruce says will trigger seven years of tribulation once he signs a pact with Israel. And Lionel has to investigate the mysterious circumstances of his drug-addled uncle's supposed death.<p> The Evangelical Christian science fiction series Left Behind: The Kids is a youth-oriented story line based on Jerry B.

That vision is about creating an Order of the Sacred Earth. Essay contributors to the book and its vision include Mirabai Starr, Brian Thomas Swimme, Adam Bucko, and David Korten.</p><p>Skylar Wilson, MA is a graduate of Philosophy, Cosmology, and Consciousness at the California Institute of Integral Studies and founder of Wild Awakenings, a wilderness journey and rites of passage organization dedicated to the thriving of Earth, life, and humanity. Skylar has experienced the healing power of wilderness over and over while guiding trips around the world for adolescents and adults over the past 15 years. Skylar is director of an inter-cultural ritual called the Cosmic Mass, which attempts to bring together the world&#x2019;s spiritual traditions into an embodied, transformational ritual that builds community through dancing and the arts. He serves on the Vision Council at the Stepping Stones Project where he continues to lead two on-going rites of passage groups for teenagers. He enjoys surfing, swimming, climbing, writing, giving and receiving bodywork, officiating weddings and end-of-life rituals, as well as one-on-one integration sessions with people of all ages and backgrounds. www.wildawakenings.com<br><br>Matthew Fox has been called a maverick, a rebel, and by some a heretic. In his quest for a viable spirituality he discovered the ancient (but often suppressed) creation spirituality tradition that honors the sacredness of all creation. He has worked closely with Native spiritual leaders, feminists, activists, and others, and got himself in trouble with his mother church and the pope. He has written 34 books on spirituality and culture now translated in 67 languages and has taught in many schools including Stanford, the University of Creation Spirituality, which he founded, and the soon to be born Fox Institute for Creation Spirituality in Boulder, Colorado. Among his books are <i>Original Blessing</i>, <i>The Coming of the Cosmic Christ</i>, <i>A Way To God: Thomas Merton's Creation Spirituality Journal</i>, <i>Meister Eckhart: A Mystic Warrior for Our Times</i>.<br><br>Jennifer Berit Listug works in book publishing as a private consultant for authors assisting with manuscript editing and book publicity.

There are now millions of us&#x2015;imaginal cells of emerging ecocentric cultures&#x2015;but what is needed is a consciously convened community that brings us together to synergistically deepen and amplify our artistry and to train and initiate others.

The historic framework of spiritual renaissance outlined in the book provides a helpful perspective for relating to this call to a new order. May everyone who reads this book be inspired to take the vows of The Order of the Sacred Earth so they may find the clarity in commitment, direction, purpose and vision the authors so generously offer!&#x201d;&#x2015;Isa Gucciardi, PhD, author of <i>Coming to Peace</i> and founding director of the Foundation of the Sacred Stream</p> <p>&#x201c;It is with great joy that I discover this vision of an Order of the Sacred Earth....Everywhere I go now, as I travel and teach, I am seeing these seeds bursting through the ravaged landscape. The youth I meet are hungry for meaningful spiritual practice and are wary of organized religion.....I want to be part of this revolutionary effort to build a holy container in which to access and express the deepest truths of love echoing from the heart of the world&#x2019;s wisdom communities in honor of &#x2018;Our sister, mother earth,&#x2019; who sustains us.&#x201d;&#x2015;Mirabai Star, spiritual teacher and author of <i>God of Love: A Guide to the Heart of Judaism, Christianity &amp; Islam</i>; <i>Caravan of No Despair: A Memoir of Loss and Transformation</i></p> <p>&#x201c;'I promise to be the best lover and defender of Mother Earth that I can be.' Might this sacred pledge required of those who join the Order of the Sacred earth save humanity and our Earth Mother? It is surely worth a try....I welcome the opportunity to find a spiritual home and intellectual identity in an Order of the Sacred Earth in fellowship with other spiritual-intellectual&#x2015; activist seekers/doers seeking a deeper truth beyond the partial and outdated cosmologies of established religious dogma and political ideology.&#x201d;&#x2015;David Korten, author of <i>Change the Story, Change the Future: A Living Economy for a Living Earth</i>; <i>When Corporations Rule the World</i>; <i>The Great Turning: From Empire to Earth Community</i></p> <p>&#x201c;What we are facing demands a strategy and commitment of this magnitude and this courage!

We have psycho-spiritual receptors for an experiential, embodied, mystical sense of the sacred Earth....Yet we are a long way from such a world. But now, with the emerging Order of the Sacred Earth,...we are closer to an articulated vision of what such a world might be. We are generating new communities who react and participate in a profoundly meaningful, mystical relationship with our shared larger body, Earth.&#x201d;&#x2015;Geneen Marie Haugen, loves to intertwine mysteries of nature and psyche and has contributed to many spirituality journals</p> <p>&#x201c;We need a new interspiritual order. One that exists outside of the current (or failing) institutions and that encourage us to, in the words of philosopher Ken Wilber, &#x2018;show up, wake up and grow up.&#x2019;...It is my hope that this new order serves as a mark of identity&#x2015;a form of tribal war paint&#x2015;so that we can see each other more clearly,....Only then can we become more human and less alone....Only then can we, as a species, live to tell a new story and find each other inside it.&#x201d;&#x2015;Joran Slane Oppelt, international speaker, author, interfaith minister and singer/songwriter and founder of the Metta Center of St. Petersburg and Integral Church there</p> <p>&#x201c;The Order of the Sacred Earth enables us to integrate our varied actions worldwide, energizing our quantum connectedness for greater personal and planetary well- being.

Zohara Meyerhoff Hieronimus, DHL, award-winning radio broadcaster (www.21stcenturyradio.com), author, social justice, environmental and animal activist</p> <p>&#x201c;The Order of the Sacred Earth can provide not merely new ideas and practices, but also a community in which to grow and to nourish them. Just as plants require soil in which to flourish, ideas and practices require strong communities....Our work succeeds when we can create caring communities in which young people are free and trust one another....So the work of the OSE is deeply revolutionary, for it challenges our most fundamental assumptions in capitalist culture. To re-image a core narrative...can, and will, be done, through the commitment to creating, through the order, a new kind of caring community.&#x201d;&#x2015;Theodore Richards, educator and founder of the Chicago Wisdom Project, author of <i>The Great Re-imagining: Spirituality in an Age of Apocalypse</i></p> <p>&#x201c;The Order of the Sacred Earth will be like that&#x2014;full of joy, because it is an invitation to participate in the evolutionary intentions of the Universe. What could be more purposeful and fun than that?! The revolution that Matthew, Skylar and Jennifer are ushering in and leading is perhaps the most important ever, because we really are on the precipice and everything, everything is at stake. So let&#x2019;s take the vow: I promise to be the best lover and defender of the Earth that I can be; roll up our sleeves and get to it! Don&#x2019;t forget to bring your banjo and dancing shoes!&#x201d;&#x2015;Kristal Parks, activist whose special commitment for ten years was to defend elephants in Kenya, author of <i>Re-Enchanting the World: A Call to Mystical Activism</i></p> <p>&#x201c;We can begin to feel our own &#x2018;impeccable warrior&#x2019; rise up to participate in what Joanna Macy has so aptly called &#x2018;The Great Turning.&#x2019; For Macy, to participate in the restoration of the earth community&#x2019;s body and spirit is to find ourselves engaging in any or all of the following dimensions: Holding Actions, propagating Shifts in consciousness, and generating structural Changes. I contend that every individual can participate in this Great Turning, and that one of the great challenges of our time is for each of us to figure out how and where we plug into this psycho-spiritual current. Perhaps the OSE can be a guiding community, helping us put our revolutionary passion into action.&#x201d;&#x2015;Trevien Stanger, tree planter who has planted 100,000 new trees and who teaches environmental studies at a community college in Vermont</p> <p>&#x201c;It is this broken world that is &#x2018;waiting,&#x2019; as Henri Nouwen wrote, &#x2018;...for new saints, ecstatic men and women who are so deeply rooted in the love of God&#x2019; that they are free to imagine a radical new political and social reality that reflects compassion and justice. It is this broken world from which Matthew Fox&#x2019;s dream of the Order of the Sacred Earth has emerged. And it is this broken world that has called forth the Holy Resistance we witnessed at Standing Rock.&#x201d;&#x2015;Adam Bucko and Rev. Chelsea Macmillian</p> <p>&#x201c;As an African American male, witnessing the suffering of poor health quality within my community, I felt I had to do something about it....Over time, I soon came to understand that the well-being in the black community is inseparable from that of everyone else and the planet as a whole. The Order of the Sacred Earth calls on us to take full responsibility for our connection to this Earth. It recognizes that we are the Earth. It understands that care of the Earth is care for ourselves, and that its health reflects that of our own. The OSE offers a great opportunity for us to come together to not only solve the problems that face our existence but to become more fully human.....the more fully human we become, the more we&#x2019;ll embrace a manner of living that is sustainable, communal, affable, loving, kind, and compassionate.&#x201d;&#x2015;Broderick Rodell, PhD, ND, whose passions include capoeira and yoga along with other learning systems to awaken values that support human evolutionary consciousness</p> <p>&#x201c;The idea and vision to have a spiritual order to celebrate, heal, and protect Mother Earth is a gallant one. To dedicate ourselves to this community will require deep prayer and the practice of nonviolence as we witness the destruction of our planet.....I hear the earth crying for people to rise up and act as if every decision we make will either destroy or protect the planet....The OSE is asking us to serve, give back, to become part of a spiritual order. They ask us to hope....I commit to defending mother Earth and to being in circle with those who say 'yes' to this vision.&#x201d;&#x2015;Deborah Santana, activist for peace and social justice and documentary filmmaker</p> <p>&#x201c;As I turn the last page of Matthew&#x2019;s, Skylar&#x2019;s and Jennifer&#x2019;s writing, my heart leaps with a sound &#x2018;Yes!&#x2019; One year and a half ago, when I started contributing to the Italian Association for creation spirituality, I did so out of a desire to bring the experience of the sacred out of the cage in which it has been convicted by both religious fundamentalism and materialistic atheism, and I intuitively feel that OSE may be just what we need to accomplish this....Many of us have lost a framework where our &#x2018;experience of the sacred&#x2019; can get nurtured, cultivated, and hence bear fruit....OSE, as I understand it, is precisely such a framework: its openness to all wisdom traditions, its independence from all dogmas, together with its being deeply rooted in what we all share&#x2015;a life-on this wondrous planet&#x2015;can thus be the key to open the cage.&#x201d;&#x2015;Claudia Picardi, seeker, scientist and teacher born and living in Italy who is foremost a person who is constantly striving for creative, spiritual, and intellectual freedom</p> <p>"I knew on the night of the winter solstice, sitting next to a graduate student at the Fox Institute of Creation Spirituality who was of Mennonite background, that the evening would have a very inclusive cast. We were all there to celebrate sacred earth and to begin the journey of Commitment to this Order of Sacred Earth. Now that I have had more time to spend with the various components of the book, <i>Order of the Sacred Earth</i>, I realize the seriousness of this challenge: the realignment of my life to commit to saving sacred Earth. A reading of the book really fills one with the serious nature of this new Order of Sacred Earth. Restoring a sense of the sacred to our present day population is the medicine needed to saving planet earth. There is no doubt in my mind that my sister, Dorothy Stang, known world wide as 'the angel of the Amazon' had a very 'active sense of the living landscape' around her in the Amazon. Her appreciation for Sacred Earth was enhanced by her mentor Matthew Fox when she attended the Institute of Creation Spirituality. Murdered in the Amazon, she paid the ultimate price for standing up for the rainforest and the peasant farmers earning their modest living there. This book has Dorothy written all over it. I can hear her saying, with all the hope and joy her voice can muster, 'See, we can do it, together we can save planet earth.' Just as Dot reached out to the young around her, Matthew reaches out to all the young through the likes of Skylar Wilson who has painted a challenging mountain to climb and Jennifer Berit Lustig who explains the commitment mystic warriors will need to climb this mountain." &#x2014;Tom Stang, brother to Dorothy Stang</p></p><h2>The Lost Tribe of Coney Island: Headhunters, Luna Park, and the Man Who Pulled Off the Spectacle of the Century</h2><p><p><b><i>The Lost Tribe of Coney Island</i> is an Amazon Best Book of the Month October 2014<br><i>The Lost Tribe of Coney Island</i> is a <i>New York Post</i> &#x201c;must read&#x201d;!

Hunt. At Luna Park, the g-string-clad Filipinos performed native dances and rituals before a wide-eyed public in a mocked-up tribal village. Millions of Americans flocked to see the tribespeople slaughter live dogs for their daily canine feasts and to hear thrilling tales of headhunting. The Igorrotes became a national sensation&#x2014;they were written up in newspaper headlines, portrayed in cartoons, and even featured in advertising jingles, all fueled by Truman&#x2019;s brilliant publicity stunts.</p><p>By the end of the summer season, the Igorrote show had made Truman a rich man. But his genius had a dark side and soon he would be on the run across America with the tribe in tow, pursued by ex-wives, creditors, Pinkerton detectives, and the tireless agents of American justice.</p><p>Award-winning journalist Claire Prentice brings this forgotten chapter in American history to life with vivid prose and rich historical detail.

The cobblestoned streets of St. James ring with jazz as Britain races forward into an age of peace and prosperity. London's back alleys, however, are filled with broken soldiers and still enshadowed by the lingering horrors of the Great War. <br><br> Only a few years removed from the trenches of Flanders himself, Lieutenant Eric Peterkin has just been granted membership in the most prestigious soldiers-only club in London: The Britannia. But when a gentleman's wager ends with a member stabbed to death, the victim's last words echo in the Lieutenant's head: that he would "soon right a great wrong from the past." <br><br> Eric is certain that one of his fellow members is the murderer: but who? Captain Mortimer Wolfe, the soldier's soldier thrice escaped from German custody? Second Lieutenant Oliver Saxon, the brilliant codebreaker? Or Captain Edward Aldershott, the steely club president whose Savile Row suits hide a frightening collision of mustard gas scars? <br><br> Eric's investigation will draw him far from the marbled halls of the Britannia, to the shadowy remains of a dilapidated war hospital and the heroin dens of Limehouse. And as the facade of gentlemenhood cracks, Eric faces a Matryoshka doll of murder, vice, and secrets pointing not only to the officers of his own club but the very investigator assigned by Scotland Yard.</p><p>Christopher Huang grew up in Singapore, where he served his two years of National Service as an Army Signaller.

The papers, many of them previously inaccessible to non-specialist readers, deal with such fundamental issues as the relationship between style and content in the exploration of ethical issues; the nature of ethical attention and ethical knowledge and their relationship to written forms and styles; and the role of the emotions in deliberation and self-knowledge. Nussbaum investigates and defends a conception of ethical understanding which involves emotional as well as intellectual activity, and which gives a certain type of priority to the perception of particular people and situations rather than to abstract rules. She argues that this ethical conception cannot be completely and appropriately stated without turning to forms of writing usually considered literary rather than philosophical. It is consequently necessary to broaden our conception of moral philosophy in order to include these forms. Featuring two new essays and revised versions of several previously published essays, this collection attempts to articulate the relationship, within such a broader ethical inquiry, between literary and more abstractly theoretical elements.<br></p><p>This volume collects my published papers on the relationship between literature and philosophy, especially moral philosophy.<br><strong>Martha C.

The daughter of a Algonquin mother and an Iroquois father, Catherine/Saint Kateri Tekakwitha (1656-1680) has become known over the centuries as a Catholic convert so holy that, almost immediately upon her death, she became the object of a cult. Today she is revered as a patron saint by Native Americans and the patroness of ecology and the environment by Catholics more generally, the first Native North American proposed for sainthood.<br><br>Tekakwitha was born at a time of cataclysmic change, as Native Americans of the northeast experienced the effects of European contact and colonization. A convert to Catholicism in the 1670s, she embarked on a physically and mentally grueling program of self-denial, aiming to capture the spiritual power of the newcomers from across the sea. Her story intersects with that of Claude Chaucheti�re, a French Jesuit of mystical tendencies who came to America hoping to rescue savages from sin and paganism. But it was Claude himself who needed help to face down his own despair. He became convinced that Tekakwitha was a genuine saint and that conviction gave meaning to his life. Though she lived until just 24, Tekakwitha's severe penances and vivid visions were so pronounced that Chaucheti�re wrote an elegiac hagiography shortly after her death.<br><br>With this richly crafted study, Allan Greer has written a dual biography of Saint Kateri Tekakwitha and Chaucheti�re, unpacking their cultures in Native America and in France. He examines the missionary and conversion activities of the Jesuits in Canada, and explains the Indian religious practices that interweave with converts' Catholic practices. He also relates how Tekakwitha's legend spread through the hagiographies and to areas of the United States, Canada, Europe, and Mexico in the centuries since her death. The book also explores issues of body and soul, illness and healing, sexuality and celibacy, as revealed in the lives of a man and a woman, from profoundly different worlds, who met centuries ago in the remote Mohawk village of Kahnawake.<br></p><p><br><strong>Allan Greer</strong> is Professor of History and Canada Research Chair at McGill University. He is the author of <em>The People of New France</em>, <em>Peasant, Lord, and Merchant: Rural Society in Three Quebec Parishes, 1740-1840</em>, <em>The Jesuit Relations: Natives and Missionaries in Seventeenth-Century North America</em>, and co-editor of <em>Colonial Saints: Discovering the Holy in the Americas, 1500-1800</em>.<br><br>"The finest scholarly treatment to date of Catherine (Kateri) Tekakwitha."--Lisa Poirier, <em>Church History</em><p></p><br>"The finest scholarly treatment to date of Catherine (Kateri) Tekakwitha....

But in this compelling account Omer Bartov reveals a very different history, as he probes the experience of the average soldier to show just how thoroughly Nazi ideology permeated the army.<br><br>In <em>Hitler's Army</em>, Bartov focuses on the titanic struggle between Germany and the Soviet Union--where the vast majority of German troops fought--to show how the savagery of war reshaped the army in Hitler's image. Both brutalized and brutalizing, these soldiers needed to see their bitter sacrifices as noble patriotism and to justify their own atrocities by seeing their victims as subhuman. In the unprecedented ferocity and catastrophic losses of the Eastrn front, he writes, soldiers embraced the idea that the war was a defense of civilization against Jewish/Bolshevik barbarism, a war of racial survival to be waged at all costs. Bartov describes the incredible scale and destruction of the invasion of Russia in horrific detail. Even in the first months--often depicted as a time of easy victories--undermanned and ill-equipped German units were stretched to the breaking point by vast distances and bitter Soviet resistance. Facing scarce supplies and enormous casualties, the average soldier sank to ta a primitive level of existence, re-experiencing the trench warfare of World War I under the most extreme weather conditions imaginable; the fighting itself was savage, and massacres of prisoners were common. Troops looted food and supplies from civilians with wild abandon; they mercilessly wiped out villages suspected of aiding partisans. Incredible losses led to recruits being thrown together in units that once had been filled with men from the same communities, making Nazi ideology even more important as a binding force. And they were further brutalized by a military justice system that executed almost 15,000 German soldiers during the war. Bartov goes on to explore letters, diaries, military reports, and other sources, showing how widespread Hitler's views became among common fighting men--men who grew up, he reminds us, under the Nazi regime. In the end, they truly became Hitler's army.<br><br>In six years of warfare, the vast majority of German men passed through the <em>Wehrmacht</em> and almost every family had a relative who fought in the East. Bartov's powerful new account of how deeply Nazi ideology penetrated the army sheds new light on how deeply it penetrated the nation. <em>Hitler's Army</em> makes an important correction not merely to the historical record but to how we see the world today.<br></p><p><br><strong>Omer Bartov</strong> is Visiting Raoul Wallenberg Professor at Rutgers University, and is the author of <em>The Eastern Front, 1941-1945</em>.<br><br>"Insightful, stimulating, compelling, controversial.

Dorondo, <em>Western Carolina University</em><p></p><br>"An important new book....Rather convincingly, Bartov asserts that the savagery of war reshaped the Werhmacht in Hitler's image and that the Wermcht embraced the idea of war as a defence of civilization against 'Jewish/Bolshevik barbarism.'"--<em>Canadian Jewish News</em> (Toronto)<p></p><br>"A unique interpretation of a much disputed subject."--T.E.

Richmond, University of Texas at Arlington<p></p><br>"While Bartov's book is important in its own right as a contribution to a contentious debate about the nature of nazi Germany, this brief summary should indicate that it also has implications for the study of armies and warfare beyond the period of the Third Reich."--Bob Moore, <em>The English</em> <em>Historical Review</em><p></p><br></p><h2>First Corinthians: Interpretation: A Bible Commentary for Teaching and Preaching</h2><p><p>Paul's first letter to the Corinthians was addressed originally to a fledgling mission church in Corinth.

Set in London, Tokyo, and Moscow, <i>Pattern Recognition</i> takes the reader on a tour of a global village inhabited by power-hungry marketeers, industrial saboteurs, high-end hackers, Russian mob bosses, Internet fan-boys, techno archeologists, washed-out spies, cultural documentarians, and our heroine Cayce Pollard--a soothsaying "cool hunter" with an allergy to brand names.<p> Pollard is among a cult-like group of Internet obsessives that strives to find meaning and patterns within a mysterious collection of video moments, merely called "the footage," let loose onto the Internet by an unknown source. Her hobby and work collide when a megalomaniac client hires her to track down whoever is behind the footage.

With <i>Pattern Recognition</i>, Gibson skips the extrapolation and focuses his acumen on our confusing contemporary world, using the precocious Pollard to personify and humanize the uncertain anxiety, optimistic hope, and downright fear many feel when looking to the future. The novel is filled with Gibson's lyric descriptions and astute observations of modern life, making it worth the read for both cool hunters and their prey. <i>--Jeremy Pugh</i></p><b>William Gibson</b>&#x2019;s first novel, <i>Neuromancer</i>, won the Hugo Award, the Philip K.

As the role of money in politics soared and important issues were taken out of public contestation, a system of &#x201c;rights without democracy&#x201d; took hold. Populists who rail against this say they want to return power to the people. But in practice they create something just as bad: a system of &#x201c;democracy without rights.&#x201d; The consequence, as Yascha Mounk shows in this brilliant and timely book, is that trust in politics is dwindling. Citizens are falling out of love with their political system. Democracy is wilting away. Drawing on vivid stories and original research, Mounk identifies three key drivers of voters&#x2019; discontent: stagnating living standards, fear of multiethnic democracy, and the rise of social media. To reverse the trend, politicians need to enact radical reforms that benefit the many, not the few.</p><p><i>The People vs. Democracy</i> is the first book to describe both how we got here and what we need to do now.

As much as Donald J. Trump might fancy himself one of a kind, Mounk argues that the American president is part of a global wave. Populist forces are surging in Britain, Germany, Italy and France; in places like Venezuela, Hungary, Turkey and Poland they have already settled in, set up house and gotten around to the next step: gutting institutional safeguards in order to shore up their rule.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Mounk&#x2019;s extraordinary new book...provides a clear, concise, persuasive, and insightful account of the conditions that made liberal democracy work&#x2015;and how the breakdown in those conditions is the source of the current crisis of democracy around the world.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>The Guardian</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A trenchant survey from 1989, with its democratic euphoria, to the current map of autocratic striving...

On the contrary, less than a third of millennials in America believe that it is extremely important to live in a democracy, compared to over two-thirds of older Americans...

In <i>Hippie</i>, he tells the story of Paulo, a young, skinny Brazilian man with a goatee and long, flowing hair, who dreams of becoming a writer, and Karla, a Dutch woman in her twenties who has been waiting to find a companion to accompany her on the fabled hippie trail to Nepal. <br><br>After meeting each other in Amsterdam, she convinces Paulo to join her on a trip aboard the Magic Bus that travels from Amsterdam to Istanbul and across Central Asia to Kathmandu. As they embark on this journey together, Paulo and Karla explore a love affair that awakens them on every level and leads to choices and decisions that will set the course for their lives thereafter.</p><p>Paulo Coelho&#x2019;s life remains the primary source of inspiration for his books. He has flirted with death, escaped madness, dallied with drugs, withstood torture, experimented with magic and alchemy, studied philosophy and religion, read voraciously, lost and recovered his faith, and experienced the pain and pleasure of love. In searching for his own place in the world, he has discovered answers for the challenges that everyone faces. He believes that within ourselves we have the necessary strength to find our own destiny. <br><br>His books have been translated into 81 languages and have sold more than 225 million copies in more than 170 countries. His 1988 novel, <i>The Alchemist, </i>has sold more than 85 million copies and has been cited as an inspiration by people as diverse as Malala Yousafzai and Pharrell Williams. <br><br>He is a member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters and has received the Chevalier de l&#x2019;Ordre National de la L�gion d&#x2019;Honneur. In 2007, he was named a United Nations Messenger of Peace.<p>The stories that follow come from my personal experiences. I&#x2019;ve altered the order, names, and details of the people here, I was forced to condense some scenes, but everything that follows truly happened to me. I&#x2019;ve used the third person because this allowed me to give characters&nbsp; unique voices with which to describe their lives.<br> &nbsp;<br>***<br><br> In September 1970, two sites squared off for the title of the center of the world: Piccadilly Circus, in London, and Dam Square, in Amsterdam. But not everyone knew this: if you asked most people, they&#x2019;d have told you: &#x201c;The White House, in the US, and the Kremlin in the USSR.&#x201d; These people tended to get their information from newspapers, television, radio, media that were already entirely outdated and that would never regain the relevance they had when first invented.<br><br> In September 1970, airplane tickets were outrageously expensive, which meant only the rich could travel. OK, that wasn&#x2019;t entirely true for an enormous number of young people whom these outdated media outlets could see only for their outward appearance: they wore their hair long, dressed in bright-colored clothing never took a bath (which was a lie, but these young kids didn&#x2019;t read the newspaper, and the older generation believed any news item that served to denigrate those they considered &#x201c;a danger to society and common decency&#x201d;). They were a danger to an entire generation of diligent young boys and girls trying to succeed in life, with their horrible example of lewdness and &#x201c;free love,&#x201d; as their detractors liked to say with disdain. Well, this ever-growing number of kids had a system for spreading news that no one, absolutely no one, ever managed to detect.<br><br> The &#x201c;Invisible Post&#x201d; couldn&#x2019;t be bothered to discuss the latest Volkswagen or the new powdered soaps that had just been launched around the globe. It limited its news to the next great trail awaiting explorationby those insolent, dirty kids practicing &#x201c;free love&#x201d; and wearing clothes no one with any taste would ever put on. The girls with their braided hair covered in flowers, their long dresses, bright-colored<b> </b>shirts and no bras, necklaces of all shapes and sizes; the boys&nbsp; with their hair and beards that hadn&#x2019;t been cut for months. They wore faded jeans with tears from overuse because jeans were expensive everywhere in the world&#x2014;except for the US, where they&#x2019;d emerged<b> </b>from the ghetto of factory workers and were worn at all the major open-air shows in and around San Francisco.<br><br> The &#x201c;Invisible Post&#x201d; existed because people were always going to these concerts, swapping ideas about where they ought to meet next, how they could explore the world without jumping aboard one of those tourist buses where a guide described the sights while the younger people grew bored and the old people dozed. And so, thanks to word of mouth, everyone knew where the next concert was to take place or where to find the next great trail to be explored. No one had any financial restrictions because, in this community, everyone&#x2019;s favorite author wasn&#x2019;t Plato or Aristotle or comics from some artist who&#x2019;d attained celebrity status,the big book, which almost no one who traveled to the Old Continent did so without, went by the name <i>Europe on 5 Dollars a Day.</i> With this book, everyone could find out where to stay, what to see, where to eat, where to meet, and where to catch live music while hardly spending a thing.<br><br> Frommer&#x2019;s only error at the time was having limited his guide to Europe. Were there not perhaps other interesting places to see? Weren&#x2019;t there those who would rather go to India than to Paris? Frommer would address this failing a few years later, but until such time the &#x201c;Invisible Post&#x201d; took it upon itself to promote a South American itinerary ending at the once-&#x201c;lost&#x201d; city of Machu Picchu, with the warning not to mention anything to those who were outside of the hippie culture, lest the place be invaded by wild animals with cameras and extensive explanations (quickly forgotten) about how a band of Indians had created a city so well concealed it could be discovered only from above&#x2014;something they considered impossible, since men did not fly.<br><br> Let&#x2019;s be fair: there was a second enormous bestseller, though not as popular as Frommer&#x2019;s book, which appealed more to those who had already flirted with socialism, Marxism, and anarchy; each of these phases always ended in deep<b> </b>disillusionment with the system invented by those who professed that &#x201c;it was inevitable that the workers of the world would seize power.&#x201d; Or that &#x201c;religion is the opium of the masses,&#x201d; which only proved that whoever uttered such a stupid statement understood little about the masses and even less about opium: among the things these poorly dressed kids believed in were God, gods, goddesses, angels, that sort of thing. The only problem is that the book, <i>The Morning of the Magicians</i>, written by the Frenchman Louis Pauwels and the Russian Jacques Bergier&#x2014;mathematician, ex-spy, tireless student of the occult&#x2014; said exactly the opposite of political manuals: the world is made up of the most interesting things. There were alchemists, wizards, Cathars, Templars, and other words that meant it never had much success in the bookstores. A single copy was read by&#x2014;at a minimum&#x2014;ten people, given its exorbitant price. Anyway, Machu Picchu was in this book, and everyone wanted to go there, to Peru, and that&#x2019;s where you could find young people from all over the world (well, all over the world is a bit of an exaggeration, because those who lived in the Eastern Bloc didn&#x2019;t have the easiest time leaving their respective countries.)<br> &nbsp;<br>***<br> &nbsp;<br> Anyway, getting back to our story:<b> </b>young people from all corners of the globe who had managed at least one priceless good known as a &#x201c;passport&#x201d; met up on the so-called hippie trails. No one knew exactly what the word &#x201c;hippie&#x201d; meant, and it didn&#x2019;t much matter. Perhaps it meant &#x201c;a large tribe without a leader&#x201d; or &#x201c;delinquents who don&#x2019;t steal,&#x201d; or all the other descriptions we already covered earlier in this chapter.<br><br> Passports, these tiny little books issued by governments and placed along with cash (a lot or little, it doesn&#x2019;t really matter) inside a belt worn around the waist, served two purposes. The first, as we all know, was for crossing borders&#x2014;as long as the border guards didn&#x2019;t get caught up in the news reports and decide to send someone back because they weren&#x2019;t accustomed to those clothes and that hair, or those flowers and those necklaces and those beads and those smiles belonging to people who seemed to live in a constant state of ecstasy&#x2014;a state normally, though often unjustly, attributed to diabolical drugs that, according to the press, these young people consumed in ever greater quantities.<br><br> A passport&#x2019;s second purpose was to get its owner out of extreme situations where they&#x2019;d run out of money and had nowhere to appeal for help. In such cases, the &#x201c;Invisible Post&#x201d; always provided much-needed information regarding locations where a passport might be sold. The price varied according to the country: a passport from Sweden, where everyone was blond, tall, and blue-eyed, wasn&#x2019;t worth much, since it could be resold only to those who were blond, tall, and blue-eyed, and so these were never the most sought-after. But a Brazilian passport was worth a fortune on the black market&#x2014;the country was home not only to the blond, tall, and blue-eyed, but also to those who were tall and short, black people with dark eyes, Asians with narrow eyes, others of mixed race, Indians, Arabs, Jews; in other words, an enormous cultural melting pot that made a Brazilian passport one of the most coveted on the planet.<br><br> Once he&#x2019;d sold this passport, the original owner would go to his country&#x2019;s consulate and, feigning horror and distress, explain that he&#x2019;d been mugged and everything taken&#x2014;he was completely out of money and had no passport. The consulates of wealthier countries would furnish a new passport and a free flight back to a traveler&#x2019;s country of origin, an offer immediately declined under the allegation that &#x201c;somebody owes me a hefty sum, I need to get what&#x2019;s mine before I go.&#x201d; The poorer countries, often governed by harsh regimes in the hands of generals, would conduct a veritable interrogation to determine whether the applicant wasn&#x2019;t on a list of &#x201c;terrorists&#x201d; wanted for subversion. Once they&#x2019;d verified that the young woman (or man) had a clean record, these countries were bound, against their will, to issue the new document. And they never offered a return flight, because they had no interest in having such derelicts influence generations that had been raised to respect God, family, and property.<br> &nbsp;<br>***<br> &nbsp;<br>Returning to the trails: after Machu Picchu, the next hot spot was Tiahuanaco, in Bolivia. Then Lhasa, in Tibet, where it was difficult to enter because, according to the &#x201c;Invisible Post,&#x201d; there was a war between monks and Chinese soldiers. Of course it was difficult to imagine such a war, but everyone took it seriously and wasn&#x2019;t about to risk an endless trip to later end up a prisoner to the monks or the soldiers. Last the era&#x2019;s great philosophers, who had just split up in April of that year, had a short time before proclaimed that the greatest wisdom on the planet was to be found in India. That was enough to send all the world&#x2019;s young people to the country in search of wisdom, knowledge, gurus, vows of poverty, enlightenment, and communion with<b> </b>My Sweet Lord.<br><br>The &#x201c;Invisible Post,<b>&#x201d; </b>however, warned that Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, famed guru to the Beatles, had tried to engage in sexual relations with Mia Farrow. The actress had always been unhappy in love through the years.&nbsp; She had traveled to India at the invitation of the Beatles,possibly in the hope of finding a cure for other traumas related to her sexuality, which seemed to hound her like bad karma.<br><br>But everything suggests that Farrow&#x2019;s bad karma had accompanied her, John, Paul, George, and Ringo on their trip. According to Farrow, she was meditating in the great seer&#x2019;s cave when he grabbed her and tried to force her into sexual relations. By this point in the trip, Ringo had already returned to England because his wife hated Indian food and Paul had also decided to abandon the retreat, convinced that it wasn&#x2019;t doing anything for him.<br><br>Only George and John remained in the Maharishi&#x2019;s temple when Mia came looking for them, in tears, and told them what had happened. The two immediately packed their bags, and when the Enlightened One came to ask what was going on, Lennon gave him a bruising response:<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the fucking Enlightened One, are you not? You ought to be able to figure it out.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br>***<br> &nbsp;<br>Now, in September 1970, women ruled the world&#x2014;or, more precisely, young hippie women ruled the world. Wherever they went, the men did so knowing these women weren&#x2019;t about to be seduced by the latest trends&#x2014;the women knew much more about the subject than the men did. And so the men decided to accept once and for all that they needed these women;they constantly wore an expression of yearning, as though begging, &#x201c;Please protect me, I&#x2019;m all alone and I can&#x2019;t find anyone, I think the world&#x2019;s forgotten me and love has forsaken me forever.&#x201d; The women had their pick of men and never gave a thought to marriage, only to having a good time enjoying wild, intense sex. When it came to the important things, and even the most superficial and irrelevant, they had the last word. However, when the &#x201c;Invisible Post&#x201d; brought news of Mia Farrow&#x2019;s sexual assault and Lennon&#x2019;s reaction, these women immediately decided to change their itineraries.<br><br>A new hippie trail was created, from Amsterdam to Kathmandu, on a bus that charged a fare of approximately a hundred dollars and traveled through countries that must have been pretty interesting:<b> </b>Turkey, Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and part of India (a great distance from the Maharishi&#x2019;s temple, it&#x2019;s worth noting). The trip lasted three weeks and an insane number of miles.<br> &nbsp;<br><br></p></p><h2>The Water Dancer (Oprah&#39;s Book Club): A Novel</h2><p><b><b>OPRAH&#x2019;S BOOK CLUB PICK �&nbsp;</b>From the National Book Award&#x2013;winning author of <i>Between the World and Me, </i>a boldly conjured debut novel about a magical gift, a devastating loss, and an underground war for freedom.<br><br>&#x201c;This potent book about America&#x2019;s most disgraceful sin establishes [Ta-Nehisi Coates] as a first-rate novelist.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br>&#x201c;Nearly every paragraph is laced through with dense, gorgeously evocative descriptions of a vanished world and steeped in its own vivid vocabulary.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Entertainment Weekly</i></b><br> <br>Young Hiram Walker was born into bondage.

Written by one of today&#x2019;s most exciting thinkers and writers, <i>The Water Dancer </i>is<i> </i>a propulsive, transcendent work that restores the humanity of those from whom everything was stolen.<br><br><b>Advance praise for&nbsp;<i>The Water Dancer</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In prose that&nbsp;sings&nbsp;and imagination that&nbsp;soars, Coates further cements himself as one of this generation&#x2019;s most important writers, tackling one of America&#x2019;s oldest and darkest periods with&nbsp;grace&nbsp;and&nbsp;inventiveness.&nbsp;This is bold, dazzling, and not to be missed.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly&nbsp;</i>(starred review)<br><br></b>&#x201c;Coates brings his considerable talent for racial and social analysis to his debut novel, which captures the brutality of slavery and explores the underlying truth that slaveholders could not dehumanize the enslaved without also dehumanizing themselves. Beautifully written, this is a deeply and soulfully imagined look at slavery and human aspirations.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2014;Booklist&nbsp;</i>(starred review)</b></p><p><b>Ta-Nehisi Coates </b>is the author of <i>The Beautiful Struggle</i>, <i>We Were Eight Years in Power</i>, and <i>Between the World and Me</i>, which won the National Book Award in 2015. He is the recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship. Coates lives in New York City with his wife and son.And I could only have seen her there on the stone bridge, a dancer wreathed in ghostly blue, because that was the way they would have taken her back when I was young, back when the Virginia earth was still red as brick and red with life, and though there were other bridges spanning the river Goose, they would have bound her and brought her across this one, because this was the bridge that fed into the turnpike that twisted its way through the green hills and down the valley before bending in one direction, and that direction was south.<br><br>I had always avoided that bridge, for it was stained with the remembrance of the mothers, uncles, and cousins gone Natchez-way. But knowing now the awesome power of memory, how it can open a blue door from one world to another, how it can move us from mountains to meadows, from green woods to fields caked in snow, knowing now that memory can fold the land like cloth, and knowing, too, how I had pushed my memory of her into the &#x201c;down there&#x201d; of my mind, how I forgot, but did not forget, I know now that this story, this Conduction, had to begin there on that fantastic bridge between the land of the living and the land of the lost.<br><br>And she was patting juba on the bridge, an earthen jar on her head, a great mist rising from the river below nipping at her bare heels, which pounded the cobblestones, causing her necklace of shells to shake. The earthen jar did not move; it seemed almost a part of her, so that no matter her high knees, no matter her dips and bends, her splaying arms, the jar stayed fixed on her head like a crown. And seeing this incredible feat, I knew that the woman patting juba, wreathed in ghostly blue, was my mother.<br><br>No one else saw her&#x2014;not Maynard, who was then in the back of the new Millennium chaise, not the fancy girl who held him rapt with her wiles, and, most strange, not the horse, though I had been told that horses had a nose for things that stray out from other worlds and stumble into ours. No, only I saw her from the driver&#x2019;s seat of the chaise, and she was just as they&#x2019;d described her, just as they&#x2019;d said she&#x2019;d been in the olden days when she would leap into a circle of all my people&#x2014;Aunt Emma, Young P, Honas, and Uncle John&#x2014;and they would clap, pound their chests, and slap their knees, urging her on in double time, and she would stomp the dirt floor hard, as if crushing a crawling thing under her heel, and bend at the hips and bow, then twist and wind her bent knees in union with her hands, the earthen jar still on her head. My mother was the best dancer at Lockless, that is what they told me, and I remembered this because she&#x2019;d gifted me with none of it, but more I remembered because it was dancing that brought her to the attention of my father, and thus had brought me to be. And more than that, I remembered because I remembered everything&#x2014;everything, it seemed, except her.<br><br>It was autumn, now, the season when the races came south. That afternoon Maynard had scored on a long-shot thoroughbred, and thought this might, at last, win the esteem of Virginia Quality he sought. But when he made the circuit around the great town square, leaning back, way back in the chaise and grinning large, the men of society turned their back to him and puffed on their cigars. There were no salutes. He was what he would always be&#x2014;Maynard the Goof, Maynard the Lame, Maynard the Fool, the rotten apple who&#x2019;d fallen many miles from the tree. He fumed and had me drive to the old house at the edge of our town, Starfall, where he purchased himself a night with a fancy, and had the bright notion to bring her back to the big house at Lockless, and, most fatefully, in a sudden bout of shame, insisted on leaving the back way out of town, down Dumb Silk Road, until it connected to that old turnpike, which led us back to the bank of the river Goose.<br><br>A cold steady rain fell as I drove, the water dripping down from the brim of my hat, puddling on my trousers. I could hear Maynard in the back, with all his games, putting his carnal boasts upon the fancy. I was pushing the horse as hard as I could, because all I wanted was to be home and free of Maynard&#x2019;s voice, though I could never, in this life, be free of him. Maynard who held my chain. Maynard, my brother who was made my master. And I was trying all I could to not hear, searching for distraction&#x2014;memories of corn-shucking or young games of blind man&#x2019;s bluff. What I remember is how those distractions never came, but instead there was a sudden silence, erasing not just Maynard&#x2019;s voice, but all the small sounds of the world around. And now, peering into the pigeonhole of my mind, what I found were remembrances of the lost&#x2014;men holding strong on watch-night, and women taking their last tour of the apple orchards, spinsters remanding their own gardens to others, old codgers cursing the great house of Lockless. Legions of the lost, brought across that baleful bridge, legions embodied in my dancing mother.<br><br>I yanked at the reins but it was too late. We barreled right through and what happened next shook forever my sense of a cosmic order. But I was there and saw it happen, and have since seen a great many things that expose the ends of our knowledge and how much more lies beyond it.<br><br>The road beneath the wheels disappeared, and the whole of the bridge fell away, and for a moment I felt myself floating on, or maybe in, the blue light. And it was warm there, and I remember that brief warmth because just as suddenly as I floated out, I was in the water, under the water, and even as I tell you this now, I feel myself back there again, in the icy bite of that river Goose, the water rushing into me, and that particular burning agony that comes only to the drowning.<br><br>There is no sensation like drowning, because the feeling is not merely the agony, but a bewilderment at so alien a circumstance. The mind believes that there should be air, since there is always air to be had, and the urge to breathe is such a matter of instinct that it requires a kind of focus to belay the order. Had I leapt from the bridge myself, I could have accounted for my new situation. Had I even fallen over the side, I would have understood, if only because this would have been imaginable. But it was as though I had been shoved out of a window right into the depths of the river. There was no warning. I kept trying to breathe. I remember crying out for breath and more I remember the agony of the answer, the agony of water rushing into me, and how I answered that agony by heaving, which only invited more water.<br><br>But somehow I steadied my thoughts, somehow I came to understand that all my thrashing could only but hasten my demise. And with that accomplished, I noted that there was light in one direction and darkness in another and deduced that the dark was the depths and the light was not. I whipped my legs behind me, and stretched out my arms toward the light, pulling the water until, at last, coughing, retching, I surfaced.<br><br>And when I came up, breaking through dark water, and into the diorama of the world&#x2014;storm clouds hung by unseen thread, a red sun pinned low against them, and beneath that sun, hills dusted with grass&#x2014;I looked back at the stone bridge, which must have been, my God, a half mile away.<br><br>The bridge seemed to be almost racing away from me, because the current pulled me along and when I angled myself to swim toward the shore it was that current still, or perhaps some unseen eddy beneath, pulling me downriver. There was no sign of the woman whose time Maynard had so thoughtlessly purchased. But whatever thoughts I had on her behalf were broken by Maynard making himself known, as he had so often, with hue and cry, determined to go out of this world in the selfsame manner that he&#x2019;d passed through it. He was close by, pulled by the same current. He thrashed in the waves, yelled, treaded a bit, and then disappeared under, only to reappear again seconds later, yelling, half treading, thrashing.<br><br>&#x201c;Help me, Hi!&#x201d;<br><br>There I was, my own life dangling over the black pit, and now being called to save another. I had, on many occasions, tried to teach Maynard to swim, and he took to this instruction as he took to all instruction, careless and remiss at the labor, then sore and bigoted when this negligence bore no fruit. I can now say that slavery murdered him, that slavery made a child of him, and now, dropped into a world where slavery held no sway, Maynard was dead the minute he touched water. I had always been his protection. It was I, only by good humor, and debasement, that had kept Charles Lee from shooting him; and it was I, with special appeal to our father, who&#x2019;d kept him countless times from wrath; and it was I who clothed him every morning; and I who put him to bed every night; and it was I who now was tired, in both body and soul; and it was I, out there, wrestling against the pull of the current, against the fantastic events that had deposited me there, and now wrestling with the demand that I, once again, save another, when I could not even conjure the energy to save myself.<br><br>&#x201c;Help me!&#x201d; he yelled again, and then he cried out, &#x201c;Please!&#x201d; He said it like the child he always was, begging. And I noted, however uncharitably, even there in the Goose facing my own death, that I had never before recalled him speaking in a manner that reflected the true nature of our positions.</p><h2>Wild Bill: The True Story of the American Frontier&#39;s First Gunfighter (Frontier Lawmen)</h2><p><p><b>The definitive true story of Wild Bill, the first lawman of the Wild West, by the #1 </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>bestselling author of </b><b><i>Dodge City</i></b><b>.</b><br><b></b><br><b></b>In July 1865, "Wild Bill" Hickok shot and killed Davis Tutt in Springfield, MO&#x2015;the first quick-draw duel on the frontier. Thus began the reputation that made him a marked man to every gunslinger in the Wild West.</p><p>James Butler Hickock was known across the frontier as a soldier, Union spy, scout, lawman, gunfighter, gambler, showman, and actor. He crossed paths with General Custer and Buffalo Bill Cody, as well as Ben Thompson and other young toughs gunning for the sheriff with the quickest draw west of the Mississippi.</p><p>Wild Bill also fell in love&#x2015;multiple times&#x2015;before marrying the true love of his life, Agnes Lake, the impresario of a traveling circus. He would be buried however, next to fabled frontierswoman Calamity Jane.</p><p>Even before his death, Wild Bill became a legend, with fiction sometimes supplanting fact in the stories that surfaced. Once, in a bar in Nebraska, he was confronted by four men, three of whom he killed in the ensuing gunfight. A famous <i>Harper&#x2019;s Magazine</i> article credited Hickok with slaying 10 men that day; by the 1870s, his career-long kill count was up to 100. </p><p>The legend of Wild Bill has only grown since his death in 1876, when cowardly Jack McCall famously put a bullet through the back of his head during a card game. Bestselling author Tom Clavin has sifted through years of western lore to bring Hickock fully to life in this rip-roaring, spellbinding true story.</p></p><p>TOM CLAVIN is a #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author and has worked as a newspaper and web site editor, magazine writer, TV and radio commentator, and a reporter for <i>The New York Times</i>.

His books include <i>The Heart of Everything That Is, Halsey&#x2019;s Typhoon, </i>and <i>Reckless</i>. He lives in Sag Harbor, NY.<p>"Clavin, a wily veteran of the writing trade, tacks up the truth like wanted posters in every chapter, while simultaneously savoring a few of the more fanciful falsehoods along the way, a neat trick in which he displays some ambidexterity of his own." &#x2015;<i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><i></i><br>"A vigorous yarn....Clavin writes fluently and often entertainingly of a man shrouded in legend while being all too human." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>"Well written, full of vivid characters, and detailed. Fans of the Old West and the HBO show Deadwood will appreciate the wild ride." &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i> </p><p>"Rollicking...an entertaining tale of the man and the legend." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i> </p><p>"Fascinating...a page-turner that may keep the reader up late at night." &#x2015;<i>The Oklahoman</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>"A well-written and well-researched tale of a most interesting American frontiersmen, lawman and shootist. Those interested in the true story of the life and times of Wild Bill Hickok will enjoy this book.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Washington Times</i><br><i></i><br>"<i>Wild Bill </i>will appeal to readers with a fascination for American history, particularly those with an interest in post-Civil War westward expansion. But to a wider audience that has grown up with a romanticized and possibly sanitized version of this slice of America&#x2019;s story, Clavin&#x2019;s book will offer a well-researched, entertaining, and more realistic version of America&#x2019;s past."&#x2015;<i>The Missourian</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>"Mr. Clavin&#x2019;s fast-paced biography does a good job of laying out the facts, but ultimately lets the reader decide...We shouldn't like [Wild Bill], much less respect him, but somehow, despite it all, in some deep part of us we do." &#x2015;<i>East Hampton Star</i> </p><p>"Tom Clavin...gives a nod to every gunslinger and scout of Hickok&#x2019;s time, and if that&#x2019;s not catnip to Western fans, nothing is. This book sweeps cross-country, around Indian villages and through decades as it busts myths and sets records straight, pulling readers into cowtowns and across prairies and putting mistruths to rest. That allows this to be more than strictly a history book: Clavin can also make this tale seem as comfortable as a Saturday afternoon sofa-and-blanket-session with an old black-and-white western." &#x2015;<i>Times Record</i><br><i></i></p></p><h2>Concepts for Care: 20 Essays on Infant/Toddler Development and Learning</h2><p>Leading experts in infant/toddler development have contributed succinct essays drawn from research, theory, clinical case studies, and carefully documented practice.

Of course, the Karmapa wasn't the first swan to go to the lake. In a book of immense scope, Rick Fields surveys the history of Buddhism in America from the quasi-legendary Fu-sang in the sixth century to Asian immigrant communities to the latest trends in American Buddhism. Writing as a storyteller as much as a historian, Fields takes us back to the earliest European contacts with Buddhism, most notably, Sir William Jones, who was just about to go to America on the recommendation of Ben Franklin, when at the last minute, fortunately, he chose India. His work would influence the American Transcendentalists and eventually the great Theosophist and first American convert to Buddhism, Henry Steel Olcott. A sympathetic writer, Fields is also meticulously inclusive. Besides the obvious transmitters, like D.T. Suzuki and Philip Kapleau, Fields traces the forgotten influences of Paul Carus, Ernest Fenollosa, and Dharmapala. One memorable story is of the ex-Navy submarine mechanic Heng Ju, who walked, three steps then a kowtow, over and over, all the way from San Francisco to Seattle for a berry pie. Fields has countless other stories that make <i>How the Swans Came to the Lake</i> a priceless contribution not only to Buddhism in America but to Buddhism itself. <i>--Brian Bruya</i></p>Rick Fields is the author of several books, including <i>Chop Wood, Carry Water </i> and <i>The Code of the Warrior. </i> He was formerly the editor of <i>The Vajradhatu Sun, </i> an international journal of Buddhism, and is currently the editor-at-large of <i>Tricycle: A Buddhist Review. </i></p><h2>Business Communication: A Problem-Solving Approach (Loose-Leaf)</h2><p>Business Communication: A Problem-Solving Approach hits the sweet spot for any business communication course.

Even so, many writers are stymied in getting their books published, never mind gaining significant attention for their ideas&#x2015;and substantial sales. This is the book editors have been recommending to would-be authors. Filled with trade secrets, <em>Thinking Like Your Editor</em> explains:</p><p>� why every proposal should ask and answer five key questions;</p><p>� how to tailor academic writing to a general reader, without losing ideas or dumbing down your work;</p><p>� how to write a proposal that editors cannot ignore;</p><p>� why the most important chapter is your introduction;</p><p>� why "simple structure, complex ideas" is the mantra for creating serious nonfiction;</p><p>� why smart nonfiction editors regularly reject great writing but find new arguments irresistible.</p><p>Whatever the topic, from history to business, science to philosophy, law, or gender studies, this book is vital to every serious nonfiction writer.</p></p><p><p><strong>Susan Rabiner</strong> is the former editorial director of Basic Books. She was a senior editor at Oxford University Press and Pantheon Books.</p><p><strong>Alfred Fortunato</strong> is a freelance editor and writer.</p>Two years ago, Betsy Lerner's The Forest for the Trees: An Editor's Advice to Writers offered an editor's-eye guide to aspiring writers of nonfiction. Now come Rabiner, former Basic Books editorial director turned agent, and her husband, Fortunato, a freelance book editor and writer, covering some of the same territory, but also breaking new ground. Wannabe authors might be shocked to hear that a fine writing style usually plays only a tiny role in whether a proposal becomes a book. Instead, according to the authors, the freshness of ideas and the size of the potential audience drive the process the first three rules of book publishing, as stated here, are "audience, audience, audience." In part one, on submissions, the authors discuss how to put together a book proposal and, without sounding self-serving, whether to work through an agent or go solo. In part two, they move to the writing process. Especially welcome here is their discussion of research undergirding all writing: authors and publishers, they note, sometimes become too lax about accuracy in nonfiction. Part three discusses how authors and editors (both in-house and freelance) can work together well. They offer a necessary tonic in advice about the importance of establishing a good relationship with the editor from day one that includes an author understanding that the editor's world doesn't revolve around one book. A sample proposal accompanied by a sample chapter round out the book nicely. Hopeful writers will be the primary audience for this title, and they will find useful advice on every page, but a secondary audience could include avid consumers of nonfiction who want to understand why some ideas reach book form while others do not. <p></p><p>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Business Statistics: A Decision-Making Approach</h2><p><i> <p>For 2-Semester Introductory Business Statistics Courses.</p> <p> <br> </p> </i> <p> <b>Gain an edge in today&#x2019;s workplace by applying statistical analysis skills to real-world decision-making.</b> </p> <p> <i> <b>Business Statistics: A Decision Making Approach</b>&nbsp;</i>provides you with an introduction to business statistics and to the analysis skills and techniques needed to make successful real-world business decisions.

The book is divided into two parts: the first gives background on the couple's childhoods and early life together; the second half is devoted to their dramatic escape from World War II-torn Europe. Husband and wife were both Jewish, born in Hamburg. After serving in the German army during World War I, Hans sailed to Brazil, where he wore a big hat and sailed down the Amazon. Margaret, an old family friend, joined him in 1935, and they soon married. Their honeymoon in Paris lasted four years. It was here that they began writing children's books about a curious little monkey named Fifi. By May of 1940 it was clear they must flee. So begins the second part. Tirelessly cycling by day, they boarded train after train as the Nazis occupied Paris, finally sailing to Rio. From there, it was on to New York, and within a year, <i>Curious George</i> was published. An afterword describes the balance of their lives. Borden spent years going through personal papers, notebooks, and photographs, and contacted people who knew the Reys. As a result, the book is richly detailed. Drummond's charming watercolors appear throughout, some full page, and many sharing or framing a page of text. In addition, abundant primary-source documents and photos along with original art combine to complete this attractive package. An appealing choice for biography assignments and units on World War II or refugees.<i>&#x2013;Barbara Auerbach, New York City Public Schools</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Brought together under one cover to stand as a kind of &#39;theological trinity, &#39; the books in this volume each offer a refreshingly different take on key theological issues.</p><p>This volume incorporates three previously published books (An Offering of Uncles, The Third Peacock and Hunting the Divine Fox) with an important and sizable new introduction in which Capon provides us with a rare, candid self-assessment. Looking over his life and two careers, one as an Episcopal priest/pastor and the other as an author, Capon offers us a summary?a kind of Capon 101?of his theology and its twin insistences that "Christianity is not a religion" and that "Grace is not a transaction." Here, as always, Capon's writing will be a terror to those who insist that humanity has to earn salvation and that some get it, but most don't. Others will find Capon's iconoclasm refreshing. In sum, Romance does indeed justify its subtitle. It is one man's love affair with theology, and what a man he turns out to be! <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Art of Botanical Drawing: An Introductory Guide</h2><p><i>The Art of Botanical Drawing</i> is an introductory guide to the techniques of botanical painting and drawing.

Born in England during the Industrial Revolution, he was fascinated by tales of the American countryside, and was ecstatic to move there in 1818. The life of an artist was difficult at first, however Thomas kept his dream alive by drawing constantly and seeking out other artists. But everything changed for him when he was given a ticket for a boat trip up the Hudson River to see the wilderness of the Catskill Mountains. The haunting beauty of the landscape sparked his imagination and would inspire him for the rest of his life. The majestic paintings that followed struck a chord with the public and drew other artists to follow in his footsteps, in the first art movement born in America. His landscape paintings also started a conversation on how to protect the country's wild beauty. <br><br>Hudson Talbott takes readers on a unique journey as he depicts the immigrant artist falling in love with--and fighting to preserve--his new country.</p><p><b>Hudson Talbott</b>&nbsp;has written and illustrated more than 20 children&#x2019;s books, including&nbsp;Newbery Honor winner&nbsp;<i>Show Way&nbsp;</i>(by Jacqueline Woodson),&nbsp;ALA Notable Book and VOYA Honor Book&nbsp;<i>Leonardo&#x2019;s Horse&nbsp;</i>(by Jean Fritz), and&nbsp;<i>We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story</i>, which was adapted into an animated film by Steven Spielberg. He lives in the Hudson Valley of New York and in New York City.&#x201c;The painters of the Hudson River School were grandiose, romantic, dramatic and brilliantly colorful. They also helped define the nation, championing wild America to a population that often saw nature as a thing to be feared and tamed, not celebrated. They made art with a wow factor, which is why it&#x2019;s surprising that there are so few children&#x2019;s books about this country&#x2019;s first art movement or its painters. . . . <i>Picturing America</i> traces Cole&#x2019;s life and his interest in art and nature, starting with his birth in 1801 in England, where his family witnesses the ways in which the nascent Industrial Revolution despoils English cities. . . . Talbott illustrates the narrative with beautiful watercolors, imagining the landscape Cole would have seen, and he includes reproductions of more than a dozen of Cole&#x2019;s works. . . . Talbott ends on an upbeat note. Thanks in part to Cole&#x2019;s influence, by &#x2018;the 1870s large areas of pristine wilderness were being preserved from destruction,&#x2019; Talbott writes. &#x2018;They eventually became our national parks.&#x2019;&#x201d;&#x2014;<b><i>The Washington Post</i> </b><br><br>&#x201c;Few artists have been able to capture the magic and timeless beauty of the U.S. landscape better than Thomas Cole. . . .

He lives with his family in Topanga, California.</p>K-Gr 2&#x2014;In this charming sequel, a new puppy threatens the titular feline's idyllic existence in an enjoyable spin on the "adjusting to new baby" theme. As in Won Ton: A Cat Tale Told in Haiku (Holt, 2010), Wardlaw relates his tale through a series of senryu, short unrhymed lines of haiku containing a maximum of 17 syllables. This ancient form of Japanese poetry seeks to capture the essence of a moment, and Wardlaw uses it to humorous effect to capture Won Ton's horrified reaction to the new puppy, Chopstick. Won Ton defends his territory against the newcomer and acts out. There's an altercation at the dinner bowl: "Who. Ate. My. Dinner./Your eyes say "no-no," but your/breath brags of tuna." Yelchin's cartoony illustrations, using graphite and gouache on watercolor paper, convey Chopstick's wide-eyed innocence and Won Ton's prickly vulnerability. Though this is a stand-alone sequel, there are echoes of the first book, where readers learned that Won Ton's true name is Haiku; here, readers learn that Chopstick has a true name as well (hint: a famed haiku poet). Abundant wordplay and comic elements, such as Won Ton's repeated cry: "Puthimoutputhim/outputhimoutputhim&#x2014;wait!/I said him, not me!" make this an enjoyable read-aloud. In the end, Won Ton discovers that he and the puppy have much in common: both enjoy rummaging through the garbage and cuddling with their boy. Peace is restored, and all ends happily. A wide audience of readers will be cheering Won Ton's return as well.&#x2014;Marilyn Taniguchi, Beverly Hills Public Library, CA</p><h2>The Puritan Family: Religion and Domestic Relations in Seventeenth-Century New England</h2><p><p>The Puritans came to New England not merely to save their souls but to establish a "visible" kingdom of God, a society where outward conduct would be according to God's laws.

Self-serving monarchic social systems, which collectively reduced common people to servitude, were now attacked by Enlightenment philosophers, of whom Rousseau was a leading light. His masterpiece, The Social Contract, profoundly influenced the subsequent development of society and remains provocative in a modern age of continuing widespread vested interest.</p><h2>The Everlasting Man (Dover Books on Western Philosophy)</h2><p>This classic exploration of human history vis-�-vis its link to Christianity ponders the question: What makes human beings uniquely human? In this thoughtful response to the rampant social Darwinism of the early twentieth century, G. K. Chesterton explains how religion &#x2014; a blend of philosophy and mythology &#x2014; satisfies both the human intellect and the spirit, and sets man starkly apart from any other living creature. <br>Written in 1925, this enduring polemic still strikes a modern chord. Addressing evolution, feminism, and cultural relativism within the context of religion, the book also examines religious skepticism. How does one sustain belief in Jesus Christ &#x2014; and the Church &#x2014; when, throughout history, the key to religious truth has been constantly reshaped? According to Chesterton, the shape of the key is not important. What matters is that it fits the lock and opens the door. An emphatic affirmation of Christian faith, <i>The Everlasting Man</i> is leavened with the author's characteristic wit and wisdom, and appeals to the mind as well as the heart.</p><p>What, if anything, is it that makes the human uniquely human? This, in part, is the question that G.K. Chesterton starts with in this classic exploration of human history. Responding to the evolutionary materialism of his contemporary (and antagonist) H.G. Wells, Chesterton in this work affirms human uniqueness and the unique message of the Christian faith. Writing in a time when social Darwinism was rampant, Chesterton instead argued that the idea that society has been steadily progressing from a state of primitivism and barbarity towards civilization is simply and flatly inaccurate. "Barbarism and civilization were not successive stages in the progress of the world," he affirms, with arguments drawn from the histories of both Egypt and Babylon. <p> As always with Chesterton, there is in this analysis something (as he said of Blake) "very plain and emphatic." He sees in Christianity a rare blending of philosophy and mythology, or reason and story, which satisfies both the mind and the heart. On both levels it rings true. As he puts it, "in answer to the historical query of why it was accepted, and is accepted, I answer for millions of others in my reply; because it fits the lock; because it is like life." Here, as so often in Chesterton, we sense a lived, awakened faith. All that he writes derives from a keen intellect guided by the heart's own knowledge. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i></p>Widely known as the &#34;Prince of Paradox,&#34; G. K. Chesterton was one of the most influential English writers and thinkers of the 20th century. Chesterton&#39;s prodigious talents embraced a wide range of subjects, from philosophy and religion to detective fiction and fantasy. And while his writings are light and whimsical, they are filled with direct and honest truths.</p><h2>The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom: Movie Tie-In</h2><p>MORE THAN HALF A MILLION COPIES SOLD!<br><br>The classic adventure story that inspired the new major motion picture The Way Back, directed by Peter Weir<br><br>***<br><br>In 1941, the author and six fellow prisoners of war escaped a Soviet labor camp in Yakutsk&#x2014;a camp where enduring hunger, cold, untended wounds, and untreated illnesses, and avoiding daily executions were everyday feats.

Starring Colin Farrell, Jim Sturgess, and Ed Harris.<br><br><br></p><p>Cavalry officer Slavomir Rawicz was captured by the Red Army in 1939 during the German-Soviet partition of Poland and was sent to the Siberian Gulag along with other captive Poles, Finns, Ukranians, Czechs, Greeks, and even a few English, French, and American unfortunates who had been caught up in the fighting. A year later, he and six comrades from various countries escaped from a labor camp in Yakutsk and made their way, on foot, thousands of miles south to British India, where Rawicz reenlisted in the Polish army and fought against the Germans. <i>The Long Walk</i> recounts that adventure, which is surely one of the most curious treks in history.In 1941, the author and a small group of fellow prisoners escaped a Soviet labor camp. Their march out of Siberia, through China, the Gobi Desert, Tibet, and over the Himalayas to British India is a remarkable statement about man's desire to be free.With a new Afterword by the author, and the author's Foreword to the Polish edition, this new edition of The Long Walk is destined to outrank its classic status. (6 X 9, 256 pages, map)"One of the epic treks of the human race. Shackleton, Franklin, Amundsen...history is filled with people who have crossed immense distances and survived despite horrific odds. None of them, however, has achieved the extraordinary feat Rawicz has recorded. He and his companions crossed an entire continent--the Siberian arctic, the Gobi desert and then the Himalayas--with nothing but an ax, a knife, and a week's worth of food...His account is so filled with despair and suffering it is almost unreadable.

It does not merely address the top levels of a data architecture (Zachman Framework row one or two); it provides both common and industry-specific logical models as well as data designs that may be customized to meet your requirements. The end result is a is a rich framework whose models span the higher and lower levels of a data architecture, including high-level models, logical models, warehouse designs, star schemas, and SQL scripts. You can use the data models, designs, and scripts as templates or starting points for your own modeling, an introduction to subject areas you might not be familiar with, a reference to validate your existing models, and a help to building an enterprise data architecture. The book provides techniques to transform models from one level to another, as well as tips and techniques for getting the appropriate levels of abstraction in the models. Instance tables (sample data) help bring the models to life. I have customized and used the models from the first edition on many projects in the last two years?it is an invaluable resource to me."<br>--Van Scott, President, Sonata Consulting, Inc.</p> <p>"Len Silverston has produced an enormously useful two-volume compendium of generic (but not too generic) data models for an extensive set of typical enterprise subject areas, and for various industries that any data modeler will likely encounter at some point in his or her career. The material is clearly written, well organized, and goes below the obvious to some of the more perverse and difficult information requirements in an enterprise. This is an invaluable resource for doing one's homework before diving into any modeling session; if you can't find it here, there is certainly a very similar template that you can use for just about any situation with which you might be faced."<br>--William G. Smith, President, William G. Smith &amp; Associates</p> <p>"In today's fast-paced e-oriented world, it is no longer acceptable to bury business constraints in hard-to-change data structures. Data architects must comprehend complex requirements and recast them into data architecture with vision for unforeseen futures. Len's models provide an outstanding starting point for novice and advanced data architects for delivering flexible data models. These models position an organization for the business rule age. Their proper implementation and customization allows the organization to externalize and manage business policies and rules so that the business can proactively change itself. In this way, the data architecture, based on Len's models and procedures for customizing them, becomes by design the foundation for business change."<br>--Barbara von Halle, Founder, Knowledge Partners, Inc., Co-author of <i>Handbook of Relational Database Design</i></p> <p>"These books are long overdue and a must for any company implementing universal data models.

Bean, Inc.</p> <p>"I was first introduced to The Data Model Resource Book three years ago when I was hired by a firm who wanted an enterprise data model. This company did not believe the dictum that ?all companies are basically the same;? they felt they were somehow unique. After a little analysis with Len Silverston's help, we found that we were actually quite a bit the same: we had customers, accounts, employees, benefits, and all the things you'd find in any corporation. All we had to do was adapt the product component of Len's book and we were ready to move ahead with a great framework for all of our data. A CD-ROM that accompanies the book provided scripts to build the model in Oracle very quickly. We then began mapping all of our detailed data types to the enterprise model and, voila, we could find a place for all of those various spellings and misspellings of Account Number.<br> Volume 2 of this revised edition provided even more exciting features: models of industry-specific data. I began to see interesting patterns that permeated this volume. For example, a reservation is a reservation, whether you're an airline, a restaurant, or a hotel. (We even have something similar in the oil industry--the allocation.)<br> Another concept from the book that has changed my thinking and vocabulary is the word "party." I recently managed a project in which an employee could also function as a customer and as an on-line computer user. The team was in disagreement regarding a name for this entity; but after checking The Data Model Resource Book, we realized that here we had a party playing three roles.<br> Whether your job is to jump-start a data warehouse project or borrow ideas for any subject area in your next operational database, I highly recommend The Data Model Resource Books, Revised Edition, Volumes 1 and 2 as your bible for design."<br>--Ted Kowalski, Equilon Enterprises LLC, Author of <i>Opening Doors: A Facilitator's Handbook</i></p><p><i>"These books are a must for any company implementing data models.
